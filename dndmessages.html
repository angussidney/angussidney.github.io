Many of you probably know <i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>. If not, and you are familiar with
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> or roleplaying games, you might enjoy it. If you are familiar with both, you <i>will</i> enjoy it.
</p><p>
Basically, Shamus Young, the creator, has treated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> as the fantasy campaign of a long-suffering Dungeon Master saddled with all too
typical players, and illustrated it in the form of a comic using screencaps from the movies. Brilliant idea, and very well done. And I constantly boggle that
(a) nobody did it before, and that (b) nobody has copied him yet.
</p><p>
Alas, <i>DM of the Rings</i> has recently come to an end, having told the story to the ending. Shamus has moved on to a
<a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/comic/default.aspx?c=14">new comic project</a>, which involves a collaboration with an artist. So no more movie screencap
comics from Shamus. This has led to a call from his legion of fans for someone, anyone, to fill the void:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Shamus:</b><br>
Which reminds me: This comic is popular enough that I'm surprised nobody else has done something similar. Harry Potter? Aliens? Spider-Man? X-Men? Star Trek?
Star Wars? The Matrix? There are tons of movies which are well known and take themselves very seriously, which are the two main ingredients for good satire.
I keep expecting another movie comic to appear someplace, but it hasn't happened yet.
</br></p><p>
<b>Adam Bloom:</b><br>
I think it's because the kind of person who thinks, "It would be funny to make a comic that spoofs Star Wars" is the kind of person who would read the amount
of work you put into each comic and say, "OMFG WAT???"
</br></p><p>
Whereas the kind of person who thinks, "I want to spend time and effort to make a high-quality webcomic" is not the kind of person who says, "It would be
funny to spoof Star Wars."
</p><p>
You are the rare, and wonderful, exception.

<p>
If there's one thing players love more than shopping for gear, it's complaining about not being able to get the gear they want.
</p>

<p>
Following as it does in the tradition of <i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>, the essential conceit of
this comic is that <i>Star Wars</i> as we know it does not exist. The whole thing is the invented campaign of the GameMaster, and the players don't know
anything about the story or the setting in which it happens, until it arises in the course of the game.
</p><p>
And whenever you have a situation like this, there's always a player who insists they know what's going on and what all the invented words mean,
despite all evidence to the contrary.
</p><p>
Another convention we're borrowing from <i>DM of the Rings</i> is that NPCs speak with the same yellow-tinted word balloons as the voice of the GM.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 4</h2>


<p>
Being gamers, these players are naturally geeky in other ways, which happens to include an at least rudimentary knowledge of physics. Ho boy, are they
ever in the wrong campaign for science pedants...
</p><p>
But even so, imagine trying to explain the Force to someone who's never heard of it before. I know after the first time I saw <i>Star Wars</i> back in 1977,
I was still confused about what exactly it was.

<p>
What else would any roleplayer do when placed in a room of any description?
</p><p>
The punchline needs no explanation for the veteran gamers out there. For the two of you reading this who aren't:
</p><p>
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Horrors">Tomb of Horrors</a></i> is one of the all-time classic
<i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> adventure modules. It is, in the true sense of the word, infamous for being one of the
most devious and impossibly difficult adventures ever written. Not only is it chock full of incredibly deadly monsters
and unforgivingly lethal deathtraps, but in many cases the encounters and traps are triggered for no readily apparent reason,
and cannot reasonably be avoided even by players exercising extreme caution. Anyone who has ever played this adventure
has had characters die horribly in the Tomb.
</p><p>
You'd think this would make the <i>Tomb of Horrors</i> unpopular. On the contrary, it is regarded as one of the greatest
<i>D&amp;D</i> adventures ever published, which just goes to show you the mentality of many of the DMs who ran it. It's
so popular that Wizards of the Coast revised it and released a
<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/oa/20051031a">version for <i>3.5 Edition D&amp;D</i></a>, which you can
download for free to torment your current players.

PCs always seem to be able to hold detailed discussions of their plans, despite being in situations where coherent

"— let us surrender so we don't get massacred."
</p><p>
There are many times in a GM's life when the players will do something ridiculously stupid and reckless, which would lead to
them getting killed if it happened in reality. At times like this, you throw them a lifeline. You offer them the chance to
surrender gracefully and accept an alternative, non-lethal setback, that could lead to interesting situations and adventure
in itself. At which point the players will blithely ignore it and charge ahead anyway.
</p><p>
And <i>then</i> you can let them have it.

<p>
Obi-Wan is displaying a high level of talent in the skill of "Fast Talk the GM". The technique used here is to (not so)
subtly point out that any reasonable and intelligent person would have to agree with whatever insane and unworkable idea
the players are proposing, rather than the carefully designed and crafted setting and rules details that the GM intended.
</p><p>
And then, just when it looks like it's not going to work, he pulls out the master stroke.
</p><p>
This comic aims not only to entertain, but also to improve your own roleplaying technique. Just don't let your GM see it.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 10</h2>


<p>
It's amazing what players will try to justify. It's just a question of where the GM chooses to put the foot down.
</p><p>
Notice how the players very carefully have <i>not</i> pointed out that you'd need some insanely unrealistic reflexes to stand a chance of deflecting
blaster shots with a sword. The "laws of physics as used by players" are very selective that way.
</p><p>
Unfortunately for this particular strip, there is a paucity of suitable frames of the film in this scene for capturing images of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan
doing suitably interesting things. Unlike <i>DM of the Rings</i>, where Shamus Young regularly found great screencaps of the characters displaying all
sorts of emotions, the acting here is just too stoic for anything like that.
</p>

<p>
Characters have to crawl through a duct of some sort in any self-respecting adventure. The good part is that as a GM you can use it to send them exactly where
you want them to go.
</p><p>
Although we don't actually see them crawling through a duct in the movie, they do use a duct to escape from the droidekas and to find their way on to
the hangar deck. So we've co-opted some other scenes to fill out the time a bit. The other option was to use completely black panels, but it's nicer
having their faces in the dark.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 14</h2>


<p>
Now here's a question. In the movie, why do they split up at this point and take separate ships down to the surface? They don't give any
reason at all, they just split up:
<blockquote>
<b>Qui-Gon:</b> Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.
</blockquote>
But they have no guarantee that the ships they take will land anywhere near each other, so there's a good
chance they'll never be able to find one another again.
</p><p>
You could argue that one stowaway on a ship will be more likely to go unnoticed than two, but they're <i>Jedi</i> - nobody's going to notice
them anyway if they don't want them to. About the only moderately sensible option is that by splitting up it's more likely that at least one of
them will make it down to the planet, if some bizarre disaster should happen to befall the ship that the other is on. However, no reason at all is given,
so we're left to merely speculate on this strange decision by Qui-Gon.
</p><p>
For our comic, we had to have them split up to follow the movie continuity, so we decided to come up with at least some sort of justification.
The good part is that by putting it into the mouth of the PCs, it can be as far-fetched as we want it to be.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 15</h2>


<p>
At first I thought those little black specks on the planet were spots of dust or something. But no, if you watch a sequence of frames
you see that they're flying in formation. They're other troop carrier ships.
</p><p>
Seriously, one of the coolest things about <i>Star Wars</i> is the sweeping shots of cool-looking ships flying through space. So we thought we'd
indulge in some enormous frames.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 16</h2>


<p>
By this stage it should be obvious that the players have completely messed up the GM's plans for this campaign. He never expected them to go
down to the planet at all. But, like all good GMs, he's willing to wing things a bit and see where they lead to. Even so, there comes a time
when you just have to call a time-out and invest some more effort into coming up with something so that the players don't catch you completely
flat-footed.
</p><p>
We've deliberately set this up as a contrast to the gaming style portrayed in <i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>,
which is very much about the DM railroading the mostly unwilling players into his pre-established story. While good for comedic value, it's not how
most of us would want to play a game, if we had the choice. The <i>Darths &amp; Droids</i> GM is much more flexible and willing to work with the
players, so that they can take whatever actions they choose. While usually more fun for everyone involved, it can get a bit hairy for the GM at times.

Here we are. One of the big questions we've seen on the forums and elsewhere up to now has been how we would be handling Jar Jar. Readers have been
speculating all sorts of things. Some of you have come closer than others. We planned this out several weeks ago, so no, we haven't directly used any
of your ideas.
</p><p>
The interesting thing about Jar Jar is that he is simply <i>so</i> reviled. When an unknown video editor recut <i>The Phantom Menace</i> into
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Edit">The Phantom Edit</a></i> by cutting out various stupid and annoying bits of the original movie,
one of the major reactions was one of <i>disappointment</i> that he hadn't removed Jar Jar <i>completely</i>. Likewise, in a forum thread about this comic
in which people speculated on how we'd be handling Jar Jar, some people expressed the hope that we wouldn't include him at all.
</p><p>
But gosh, we're making comedy here. How could we <i>not</i> include Jar Jar?

<p>
One of the challenges of running or playing in a roleplaying game is making up character and place names that don't sound stupid. Some people have
a talent for it, while others... don't. Most people fall into the latter category.
</p><p>
If you're consistently good at making up fantasy or science fiction names that don't sound ridiculous, especially at short notice, then you could
probably get a job doing so for all those roleplayers who can't do it for themselves. Except for the fact that many gamers actually think that
"Steve the Barbarian" or "Hoodoo-fugu the Alien Monk" are perfectly good names.

<p>
As a player, it's vitally important to make sure the GM is reminded of every possible detail that can provide a positive modifier to your chances
of success in a critical dice roll.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, other players can gleefully do outrageous things that make them sitting targets, yet protest when anything bad happens to them.
</p><p>
At this stage it's probably also good to point out to readers who haven't checked the FAQ that we're being deliberately vague about what game
system is being used here. It has elements of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> (or <i>d20</i> as the underlying rule system is called these days),
<i>GURPS</i>, and a few other systems, all mixed together. About the only thing we really know so far is that it seems to use 20-sided dice for
skill rolls, rolling high is good, and there's various point-based character generation options. We're going to continue to play fast and loose
with the details of the game system. Consider it either some fictional commercial system, or some sort of hybrid home-brew system, as you wish.

You probably know what <i><a href="http://www.callofcthulhu.com/">Call of Cthulhu</a></i> is, but if not, it's a game based on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a> originally developed by American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.
The Cthulhu Mythos retains enduring popularity for its groundbreaking psychological horror stories, and is constantly being added to by
fans and imitators the world over. A defining feature of the Mythos is the mind-numbingly horrific creatures who dwell in its universe,
capable of literally driving humans insane by the mere fact of their existence.

Kind of like Jar Jar on several levels.

A phenomenon which often occurs in games is that a player will start coming up with explanations or revelations about the plot
that the GM had absolutely no hand in. At this stage, it's fine, since that's a simulation of the what the characters are doing - trying to
understand what's going on around them.
</p><p>
Things get interesting when what one player says becomes so compelling that the other players start taking it as the truth, believing it in
preference to what the GM actually has planned or says in contradiction.

When equipping your characters before setting out on an adventure, make sure you buy:
<ol>
<li>The best weapons you can afford and that the GM will let you get away with using.*</li>
<li>The best armour you can afford and that the GM will let you get away with using.**</li>
<li>As many marginally useful odds and end as you can get with the few coins you have left over.</li>
</ol>
* Where "best" is defined as being the ones that do the most damage.<br>
** Where "best" is defined as being the ones that prevent the most damage.
</br></p><p>
You never know when some insanely specific piece of equipment that nobody would think of buying normally might come in handy for some
situation where the GM is trying to prevent you from doing something that you'd really rather like to try doing.
</p><p>
Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan have clearly done this. Why else would they be carrying underwater breathing gear? And clearly they must be special breathing
gadgets that only work <i>underwater</i> - since they <i>didn't use them</i> when the Trade Federation tried to gas them in the waiting room on the ship
earlier. "Gosh, the room is filling with poison gas, and I have breathing gear in my pocket - I know, I'll just hold my breath and see what happens!"
The plot wouldn't be that stupid.

Right?

We had to resist very strongly the urge for Sally to say that Otoh Gunga was full of ponies. At some point in this wonderful fantasy world Sally
is building, the GM has to step in with something that requires more response than the players just marvelling at stuff.
</p><p>
"Phanastacorians" is the sort of silly name GMs come up with when pressured to invent something on the spot. The reason we know this is just such
a name is that we were discussing this script and realised we needed one, so we put someone on the spot by saying, "Okay, think of a name! Now!"
Said person blurted out, "Phanastacorians!" immediately. We knew we had to use it.
</p><p>
Of course, "Gungans" also sounds pretty much like just such a word too.

When a fellow player's freeform improvisational style makes the GM squirm, that's great. When things take a sudden turn and that player's
wild ravings start to work against the other players, you can almost hear the grin spreading across the GM's face.

On another note, "diplomacy" is one of the most versatile words in the player character arsenal. It covers pretty much any conceivable action

When you think about it, tabletop roleplaying is in some ways a pretty silly activity. At least when done properly.
</p><p>
But hey, it's a way of having fun. Even grown-ups need to play and engage their imaginations. Roleplaying games are just a somewhat more
sophisticated means to that end than what children do naturally when they play make-believe.
</p><p>
As a GM, much of the creative aspects of the make-believe fall on your shoulders. Which is why it's so good when a player comes up with
something cool and potentially dangerous that you can co-opt outright and work into the game.

We wanted the distribution of dice rolls used throughout the adventure to at least be plausible. The problem is, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan hardly fail
at anything they do in the whole movie (with one big exception near the end...). So it was good to be able to write in some low dice rolls here.
</p><p>
After such comprehensive failures, the GM has the players at his mercy. So that makes this the perfect time to throw them a quest hook as a way out
of their predicament. Looks like he might be able to salvage some of his original plot after all!
</p><p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltesers">Maltesers</a>, by the way, are delicious orb-shaped balls of chocolate-coated crunchy malt honeycomb.
The closest thing commonly available in the USA is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoppers">Whoppers</a>. We wanted something spherical, but
there simply isn't any spherical snack food that is known worldwide. And using an apple would simply not work for roleplaying food.

<p>
A few words of explanation are perhaps required here. We're taking a big left turn away from the plot of the movie.
</p><p>
Our guiding principle is that we want to follow the movie <i>visually</i>. But we are (obviously) changing the dialogue. And we are allowing
ourselves to change actual elements of the <i>plot</i> as well. We've already done this to some extent, but nothing as serious as what we're
doing here.
</p><p>
Our aim is essentially to create what could potentially be an alternative soundtrack to the film. The goal is that when we're done, you could
watch the film, redubbed with our dialogue (and some other additions to cover the scenes we're skipping), and it would all make sense.
So we're more or less following what you <i>see</i> on the screen. (We're taking a bit of licence with the strict chronological ordering
of some screencaps because otherwise we wouldn't have good shots of people for some of the dialogue.) But if something only
happens in the <i>dialogue</i> of the movie, we are free to alter it. We want to explain what's happening on the screen in a different way, a way
that actually makes sense in a bigger context.
</p><p>
This is not quite the <i>Star Wars</i> you are familiar with. You must unlearn what you have learned. Like Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, you are discovering
some of this for the first time. Enjoy the ride.
</p><p>
On another note, it's interesting to note that, after all the trouble we had early on finding expressive screencaps of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon, that
it was a real pleasure working with Boss Nass in this scene. It probably says something that the most expressive faces in the movie so far all
belong to CGI characters.

Canonically, the Jedi really <i>did</i> pass through the actual core of the planet. No, it wasn't just a cutesy Gungan folk-tale name for
"some deep but physically plausible underwater caves that actually take you a few dozen miles or so". Naboo is
<a href="http://www.starwars.com/databank/location/naboo/">geologically unique</a> and an
<a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Naboo">enigma to astrophysicists</a>, in that it doesn't have a molten magma core.
The planet is made of a porous conglomeration of large rocky bodies, permeated by caves and tunnels full of water.
</p><p>
Uh-huh.
</p><p>
Since we've established that the Trade Federation landed their invasion fleet on the opposite side of the planet to the capital city,
going through the core really is the shortest route. It's a challenge that we have to go to such lengths to explain the logic behind
something that is canonically part of the movie. But thankfully it all works in Sally-logic.

Seasoned roleplayers simply don't show any fear when confronted with giant monsters and other dangerous things that should cause any
real person to quake in their boots. As a game master, it can be difficult to generate a suitable atmosphere of tension during situations
like this.
</p><p>
But then some player can make an innocent out-of-context comment that will cause everyone to react in genuine alarm. Yeah. We're not prepared

Many roleplaying games abstract damage to people into more or less generic "damage points" of some sort. But when it comes to damaging <i>vehicles</i>,
it somehow seems much more important to determine exactly what bit of the vehicle has been damaged and what the effect of loss of a specific
component will be. This ends up meaning that the vehicle damage tables in a lot of games end up being an order of magnitude larger and more
complicated than tables describing damage to living beings.

We also learn from this comic that Jim deals with computers a lot.

Didn't we just go through this? Seriously, in the movie, there's the whole "There's always a bigger fish" gag - one giant fish grabs the bongo,
and another comes along and eats it - then they lose power and Obi-Wan fixes it. And then they go through the whole thing <i>again</i>. Another
giant fish chases them, and they escape by the fortunate intervention of a <i>fourth</i> giant fish.
</p><p>
If this sort of thing happens in your game, you'd be well justified in calling your GM uncreative. Or that he needs better random encounter tables.

One of the explicit goals we established early in our writing process was that we wanted to make Jar Jar's character <i>likeable</i>.
So many people have such a low regard for Jar Jar as a character that we really wanted to turn that on its head and make him an
entertaining and fun character in the comic. It was an enormous challenge, and we feared it might be too much of a mountain to climb,
but we tried it anyway. We humbly hope that we've succeeded on some level.
</p><p>
In the movie, the other characters actually like Jar Jar (or at least put up with him, in the case of Qui-Gon), while the audience dislikes him.
Here we want the audience to like Jar Jar (and Sally). It's interesting that one way to achieve that is to have him (her) annoy the other characters.
</p><p>
On another note, there comes a time in every GM's life when they have created something marvellous and just want the players to listen for
a minute while they read out the vivid imagery that conjures up a magical world of fantasy and adventure in the imaginations of all the
participants in this shared experience. The players, inevitably, will want to skip this boring bit and get on with the game.

Some of you may be wondering where this scene came from. The waterfall is actually a deleted scene from the movie, which is available on
the DVD release. We can see why it was cut from the film, because:
(a) <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InevitableWaterfall">it's totally a cliché</a>, and (b) it's completely ludicrous,
as Obi-Wan rightfully protests.
</p><p>
However, it does provide a nice bit of drama at this point in the comic, and it gave us a chance for a few additional gags. So what the heck,
we're throwing it in.
</p><p>
But if you ever have your characters floating down a river in a game you're running, for pity's sake, don't throw a waterfall at them.

When roleplaying, it's usually thought of as a good thing to immerse yourself in the character. Sally is good at playing make-believe, but not
quite so good at separating the fiction from the reality. She's still learning how this gaming thing operates, and hasn't absorbed the fact that
her character can do things that she wouldn't want to do in real life.
</p><p>
And the way the dice are falling, it might be some time before she trusts them.

There are some players who like to treat their favourite spell as the all-purpose answer to everything. It's usually something destructive,
like Fireball.

Orcs are attacking? Cast Fireball!
</p><p>
The evil knight is kidnapping the princess? Fireball!
</p><p>
We need a way to cross the river? Fireball!

So when players start coming up with reasons why their favourite spell might not be perfect for some occasion, best not to argue.

Dice are of course used as randomisers in most roleplaying games. Rolling poorly is a bit disappointing, but it's more than made up for by those
times when you are (literally) on a roll and everything goes perfectly.
</p><p>
Even though many gamers think their games would be perfect if they only ever rolled good dice rolls, the fact that you sometimes fail is what really
adds the excitement and fun to proceedings. Success in the face of uncertainty is more satisfying than a forgone conclusion.

When a new player joins the group, you sometimes have to explain things that you've done earlier in the game. It had all seemed perfectly
sensible and logical at the time, but somehow when it comes to trying to justify it later, the carefully constructed chain of events suddenly seems
not merely to contain a weak link, but to be constructed entirely out of stupefyingly enormous mistakes and errors of judgement.
</p><p>
This is a perfectly natural consequence of typical player character actions.
</p><p>
Incidentally, the screencap of Bibble rolling his eyes was so compelling that two of us, making different strips independently at the same time,
chose exactly the same frame grab to use. When we saw what we'd done, we laughed so much that we actually considered not only keeping it in both
strips, but using it in a third strip later on to reinforce the repetition. But in the end we decided that not reusing the same frame would be better.
(And to save people asking, it was strip #39 where we removed Bibble's eye-rolling.)

Sometimes you really have to wonder what would happen if people acted in real life the way they play their game characters' interactions with NPCs.
Non-player characters routinely get abused, called names, ordered around, spoken about in front of them as though they don't exist, and treated extremely rudely.
Not only lower class grunts either. It happens to anyone and everyone right up to the level of planetary rulers. <i>And they never seem to be upset by it.</i>
</p><p>
If "NPC" was a job you could get in the real world, it would surely rank lower than waiting tables, flipping burgers, or working in a telemarketing
call centre. <i>Much</i> lower.
</p><p>
I think that'd be a cool comeback for when someone does something rude to you, like cut you off in traffic or something. Just yell at them,
"Hey, I'm not an NPC, you know!"

Sometimes it can be really hard to get players to concentrate on a particular goal for an adventure. They'll do anything they can think of to
avoid actually making any progress towards what they're supposed to be doing.
</p><p>
Other times, the players get some idea stuck in their head and absolutely will not be diverted from it, no matter how important it is for them
to stop being so single-minded for a minute and pay attention to something else.
</p><p>
Interestingly, both of these can be infuriating for a GM.

One of the most fulfilling things about making this comic is being able to watch the movie in a completely new light - with the original dialogue,
but with our characters overlaid onto it. This scene, in particular, now cracks us up every time we watch it.
</p><p>
In fact, when we got up to this scene in our scene-by-scene review of the movie before writing new strips, we all burst into spontaneous laughter as
soon as we saw Qui-Gon simply walk up to the combat droids and start talking to them. From there, this strip virtually wrote itself.

Yes folks, it's time for another player. Last time we did this - to introduce Sally - we ended the previous strip with an explicit
break at the end of a game session. Although this strip does mark the beginning of a new session of play, we didn't bother to mention the end of the
session in the last one. That level of explicit detail would just get tedious after a while. It's not terribly important to the actual story where one
game session ends and a new one begins, so we're going to glide through them fairly seamlessly. Mostly.

<li>Mark Hamill is known (barely) for doing voiceovers for poorly selling computer games, but gains widespread fame after his appearance in the first
<i>Futurama</i> movie.</li>
<li>Harrison Ford is known primarily for <i>Indiana Jones</i>.</li>
<li>Nerdy guys make YouTube videos of themselves wielding crossbows instead of lightsabres.</li>
<li>Without the success of <i>Star Wars</i> to spark interest in science fiction in the late 70s and early 80s, <i>Star Trek</i> was never revived
with movies and new series, and remains an obscure short-running TV show.</li>
<li><i>Moonraker</i> was never made. James Bond fans never had it so good.</li>
<li>The major science fiction background that pervades all of Western culture is <i>Battlestar Galactica</i>, despite it never being much good. It was remade
recently as a new, updated television series with a bigger budget, high-tech computerised special effects, and edgy writing. And it sucked.</li>
<li>Throughout the 80s and 90s, all the greatest Hollywood blockbusters were big-budget family-oriented musicals.</li>

Many of you probably know <i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>. If not, and you are familiar with
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> or roleplaying games, you might enjoy it. If you are familiar with both, you <i>will</i> enjoy it.
</p><p>
Basically, Shamus Young, the creator, has treated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> as the fantasy campaign of a long-suffering Dungeon Master saddled with all too
typical players, and illustrated it in the form of a comic using screencaps from the movies. Brilliant idea, and very well done. And I constantly boggle that
(a) nobody did it before, and that (b) nobody has copied him yet.
</p><p>
Alas, <i>DM of the Rings</i> has recently come to an end, having told the story to the ending. Shamus has moved on to a
<a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/comic/default.aspx?c=14">new comic project</a>, which involves a collaboration with an artist. So no more movie screencap
comics from Shamus. This has led to a call from his legion of fans for someone, anyone, to fill the void:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Shamus:</b><br>
Which reminds me: This comic is popular enough that I'm surprised nobody else has done something similar. Harry Potter? Aliens? Spider-Man? X-Men? Star Trek?
Star Wars? The Matrix? There are tons of movies which are well known and take themselves very seriously, which are the two main ingredients for good satire.
I keep expecting another movie comic to appear someplace, but it hasn't happened yet.
</br></p><p>
<b>Adam Bloom:</b><br>
I think it's because the kind of person who thinks, "It would be funny to make a comic that spoofs Star Wars" is the kind of person who would read the amount
of work you put into each comic and say, "OMFG WAT???"
</br></p><p>
Whereas the kind of person who thinks, "I want to spend time and effort to make a high-quality webcomic" is not the kind of person who says, "It would be
funny to spoof Star Wars."

R2-D2's player, Pete, is what's known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-maxing">min-max gamer</a>. The art of min-maxing is to create
your character in such a way that you get the best and most useful abilities at the best levels possible, by trading them up at the expense
of character traits that are less important, less useful, or will only come up rarely in play. Character concept, background, and story are
entirely secondary to a true min-maxer.
</p><p>
Often the characteristics that are sacrificed involve physical appearance and social graces, which are usually deemed less important than the
ability to put an arrow into the eye of an orc at a thousand paces, or to be a genius capable of restructuring the universe with the power of
thought.
</p><p>
This shows the difference between Hollywood fiction and gaming fiction. If movies were made by gamers, all the heroes would be short, overweight
guys with physical disabilities.

<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 53</h2>


<p>
In the movie, this scene is inexplicable for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the "Queen" thanks R2-D2 and says he deserves gratitude for saving the ship.
But a droid is a robot - a machine - built by humans to do a specific job. That's what R2-D2 is <i>supposed</i> to be doing. As a droid, he has
standing instructions to do whatever he can to safeguard the ship and the people on board. Surely, no? Thanking a droid is like thanking your car
for graciously deigning to drive you to work in the morning.
</p><p>
Okay, clearly the droids in <i>Star Wars</i> are really meant to be seen as self-aware personalities in themselves, not mere chunks of machinery.
But still, it's a bit of an odd thing to thank a machine for doing exactly what it was designed to do.
</p><p>
Much more inexplicable is the fact that the "Queen" in this scene is a decoy, and the real Queen Amidala is hiding incognito as one of the decoy
Queen's handmaidens. Which one? Why, Padmé, the one that the decoy Queen orders to do the menial work of cleaning R2-D2.
</p><p>
Let's get this perfectly straight. Canonically in the movie, one of the Queen's handmaidens, acting as a decoy, <i>orders the real Queen</i>
to do a dirty, grubby cleaning job. And Padmé has to do it, or risk blowing her cover.
</p><p>
If you watch this scene, you can see the other handmaidens <i>smirking</i> in the background.
</p><p>
So, we had to make sense of this ridiculousness. Being a PC, R2-D2 can't be beholden to anyone who gives him commands, so the GM comes up with
the idea of optional obedience chips. And when R2 makes his lascivious request, explicitly specifying the <i>most beautiful handmaiden</i>, the decoy
"Queen" is in a bind. How can she possibly <i>not</i> choose the real Queen?
</p>

<p>
The GM is making a concession to the players here, but he's putting limits on it. As justified by Obi-Wan's marginally successful roll.
</p><p>
One thing we've noticed in reader responses to our comic is that a lot of people think our GM is a "doormat", in that the players are walking all
over him, getting their own way, and he has no control over the game. We think this is a little harsh.
</p><p>
It's possible that readers are getting this impression because of the strong contrast with our direct inspiration,
<i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>, in which the GM ruled the game with an iron fist, and didn't
let the players get away with anything. We deliberately went in a different direction with our comic, and it's certainly true that our GM lets the
players do a lot of stuff that the <i>DM of the Rings</i> GM would never countenance.
</p><p>
There is a method to this madness, though. This GM genuinely wants his players to enjoy the game. You can't enjoy the game very much if you're
constantly being railroaded into doing stuff you don't want to do. So you need to keep a loose hand on the reins. This is one of the natural
tensions of running a roleplaying game. You need to let the players do <i>most</i> of what they want to do, while keeping any restrictions on
their activities subtle to the point that they barely even notice them, because they seem natural within the scope of the setting.
</p><p>
We see our GM as a reasonably skilful proponent of the art of GMing, as judged by the fun that everyone is having. Yes, he lets the players
decide a lot of the stuff that is happening. The reason is because that allows the players to be involved in creating the story and the universe
they inhabit. Which is a heck of a lot more fun than being told a whole bunch of stuff that you can't do.

There are (at least) two approaches to roleplaying adventures. One is to treat them as puzzles and obstacles that must be overcome, by finding the
right clues and objects and acquiring them somehow. The other is to interact with the other denizens of the make-believe world as if they were
real, trying to find out what motivates them and what they know about the world.

<p>
"Third base!"
</p><p>
Okay, some of you would have got that reference, while others are now mystified as to why that line immediately above is there.
</p><p>
We write these comics in a meeting room during lunchtime at work. Someone brings a laptop and we hook it up to a projector and we look at our
file of script ideas and take turns yelling out ideas and denouncing each others' ideas as terrible. Somehow at the end of this process we end
up with the scripts we use.
</p><p>
Once we'd more or less completed this one, one of us stood up, walked over to the computer, motioned that he wanted the keyboard, and typed in
the following line:
<blockquote>
<b>R2-D2:</b> Third base!
</blockquote>
The entire room immediately cracked up in fits of hilarity. Except for one of us, who didn't know what we were laughing at.
</p><p>
The line is a reference to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_and_Costello">Abbott and Costello's</a> most well-known comedy routine,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who's_on_First%3F">Who's on First?</a> (For those of you not familiar with it and who would like to see
it, there's a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8342445135331678445">video here</a>.) Despite being a distinctly American
comedy routine, based around a discussion of baseball, it has entered the common consciousness of western culture - so much so that all but one
of us Australians were familiar with it.
</p><p>
Those of us who got the reference thought it would make an excellent punchline, as it seemed to fit the talking-at-odds nature of the dialogue
in this strip so well. The other guy argued against it, since (and he did have a point) there would be people who simply didn't get it. We argued
back that the people who <i>did</i> get it would find it gobsmackingly hilarious, as evidenced by the fact that we were still giggling uncontrollably
over it several minutes later.
</p><p>
So it stayed in the script. A few days later, one of us assembled the screencaps and put the strip together. With the "Third base" line in it.
</p><p>
And we all looked at it again in the harsh light of day and collectively went, "Naaaah.... that's not going to work."
</p><p>
There are a couple of reasons. Firstly, it really is a bit jarring, pulling the reader well out of the thin veneer of <i>Star Wars</i>-ness that usually overlays
the dialogue. Secondly, "third base" has a sexual connotation in American slang and, given where R2 is standing in relation to Padmé in the
final frame, and the previous strip where R2 requested a beautiful handmaiden to clean and oil him... well, it was straying into territory where
we really, <i>really</i> don't want to go.
</p><p>
However, even given these reasons for not including the line - which we have ultimately decided are strong enough not to include it - we still think
the line itself is inherently funny. So we didn't want to leave it out entirely, and bumped it down here to the annotation, where we can safely dissect it in
a semi-intellectual manner without endangering the style and the PG-rated nature of the comic itself.

Any NPC who the GM designs for long-term interaction with the players, either as an ally or a nemesis, is given a name. The name is probably the most
important part of the NPC, as it encapsulates everything the players will need to get to know this vital character, and allows them to refer to
the NPC with ease, as they will no doubt have to do on many occasions in the future.
</p><p>
Conversely, any NPC for whom the GM <i>doesn't</i> have a name ready to roll of the tongue as soon as a player asks is completely unimportant to the plot.
Such NPCs can be safely forgotten as soon as you leave their presence, as you'll never, ever come across them again.

One of the cool things about roleplaying games is that you get to engage in competitive haggling over the price of pretty much everything you buy.
In the modern developed world, the art of bargaining has become diluted or lost, and many of us feel the thrill of trying to negotiate a good deal
on the rare occasions when we get to do it.
</p><p>
The bad thing about doing this sort of bartering in a make-believe world is that you can easily lose all perspective of the true relative value
of the things you're trying to trade.
</p><p>
The other side effect is that <i>everything</i> becomes conceivable as a base unit of exchange.

Ah, Charisma. The classic "dump stat".
</p><p>
For those who don't know this term, <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> characters are described by six numerical statistics: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma. During character creation, players often get some leeway in assigning scores to these stats, in order to
generate a character who will be suited to their desired adventuring and loot-collecting profession.
<ul>
<li>Strength controls how well you hit and how much damage you do in combat. Important.</li>
<li>Dexterity controls how well you fire ranged weapons and how good you are at avoiding being hit in combat. Important.</li>
<li>Constitution controls how much damage you can take and how well you resist poison. Important.</li>
<li>Intelligence controls how well you can cast spells and how easily you learn skills. Important.</li>
<li>Wisdom controls how well you resist bad magic and how keen your senses are. Important.</li>
<li>Charisma controls how good you look and how well you can play music.... Yeah.</li>
</ul>
So guess which stat gets the lowest score? Anyone who <i>doesn't</i> put a low score into Charisma must be treated with suspicion. They might be into
evil stuff like "interesting character concepts" and "struggling against adversity" and "roleplaying".

Shopkeepers are always immune to being attacked in roleplaying games. There's some sort of intrinsic separation in most
players' minds between "person you can get information from, or track through a forest, or fight" and "person you buy stuff from", and never
the twain shall meet.
</p><p>
Of course this strange state of affairs has a perfectly rational explanation. Any GM worth his salt knows that shopkeepers must always be
retired adventurers with oodles of levels in martial arts or the Jewelled Sword of Hacking Impertinent Hagglers to Bits under their counter.

NPCs are somewhat complicated beasts. In order to simplify the mental book-keeping required to handle their interactions with PCs, many games summarise
their reactions to the PCs with some variously labelled statistic that essentially summarises whether they will help the PCs or if they want to do bad

Some lines from the movie work so well that we simply have to include them. We were considering not doing this strip at all, but
were swayed by the fact that:
<blockquote>
<p>
Mmm, nice ship. I hope you didn't kill anyone I know to get it.
</p>
</blockquote>
was inherently funny when transferred verbatim from the movie to our characters. It also gave us a chance to include some more characterisation for
R2-D2.
</p><p>
We stated early on that one of our goals with this comic project was to make Jar Jar into a likeable character. Given the reactions so far, we feel we've done
pretty well at that. We discussed a lot how to handle R2-D2, who is one of the most beloved characters in <i>Star Wars</i>. And we decided to make
him annoying. It was a risk, and we knew it, but we wanted to keep mixing things up. Hopefully he's not as annoying as the real Jar Jar, though.

This strip was published on 1 April, 2008: April Fools' Day. In the grand tradition of stupidity everywhere, and on the net in particular, we
originally went to air with an <a href="/episodes/0082a.html">alternative version of this strip</a>. (You can also see it and do
a blink comparison by mousing over the image on this page.) Here's the annotation text as it appeared:
<blockquote>
<p>
We regret to have to announce that we have received a cease-and-desist letter relating to our work on <i>Darths &amp; Droids</i>. As a result of
this correspondence and some deeply considered thought, we are discontinuing our use of screenshots from the movie.
</p><p>
However, we still have scripts and story ideas to carry us a long way yet, so we are not giving up the comic altogether. We shall continue on,
with just one minor change: All of the images used in the comics will be created by us.
</p><p>
Of course we'd like to recreate the visuals from the movies as closely as we can, but naturally our time and budget are limited. We'll do the best
we can. Hopefully this change won't be too jarring in the long run.
</p><p>
We thank you in anticipation of your continued support.
</p>
</blockquote>
Of course, this was a complete fabrication and practical joke. We haven't received any such letter, and we are not discontinuing our use of screencaps.
In fact, George Lucas is known amongst the fan community as being particularly welcoming of fan works based on <i>Star Wars</i>. We have no idea if
he or anyone at Lucasfilm knows about <i>Darths &amp; Droids</i>, but we'd bet that if he did, he'd have a good chuckle and leave us be.
</p><p>
We had the idea to do this joke strip some time ago and we discussed it at length. Our fear was that some readers might not appreciate that it was
a joke and get angry enough to write or otherwise contact Lucasfilm, which could have the effect of notifying some lawyers there about our previously
undetected activity, leading ultimately to an <i>actual</i> cease-and-desist notice.
</p><p>
In the end we decided that:
<ol>
<li>It was unlikely anyone would both believe what we said on April Fools' Day and then actually go to the trouble of contacting Lucasfilm,
especially within 48 hours before the next comic update.</li>
<li>Even if someone did, Lucasfilm wouldn't have a problem with us.</li>
<li>Even if they did, we'd be legally able to continue making comics because it's clearly parody and our site is hosted in the USA.</li>
<li>And if we got sued anyway, we could go out with a bang. "Yeah, we got shut down by Lucasfilm. How cool is that?"</li>
</ol>
All in all, it was a spectacularly bad plan. <i>But at least it's spectacular!</i>

Many of you no doubt know enough about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type">blood types</a> to appreciate just how little Jim seems to know about them.
For those who don't, the simple version is as follows:
</p><p>
The main classification scheme for blood types (there are additional ones of lesser importance) is the combination of the ABO and Rh systems, which record
the presence of specific <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antigen">antigens</a> in the blood. In short, the letters A and B indicate the presence of
the so-called type A and type B antigens respectively. A person with type AB blood has <i>both</i>, while a person with O has neither. The Rh designation
records the presence of the Rh antigen as Rh-positive, and the absence as Rh-negative.
</p><p>
The presence of antigens restricts who you can safely donate blood to. If you transfuse blood containing any given antigen to someone whose blood <i>doesn't</i>
already contain it, that causes severe problems. Type O-negative blood (i.e. Type O which is also Rh-negative) contains no antigens, so can safely be given
to anyone. On the other hand, if you have type AB-positive blood, then you already have every antigen, so it doesn't matter what type the blood given to you is.
For this reason, type O-negative is called the <i>universal donor</i> blood type, while AB-positive is called the <i>universal recipient</i>.
</p><p>
As mentioned already, there are other additional antigens and blood typing systems which come into play occasionally, but these are relatively rare.

This is a classic example of "RPG time", which is what happens when characters have detailed discussions of things that take fractions of a second to
occur in the reality of the game world. The classic example is players stopping to have extended discourses on their group combat tactics
<i>in the middle of a fight scene</i>, when if the fight was really happening, they'd have had their asses kicked before they could even open their mouths.
</p><p>
Here we see Qui-Gon hold such a discussion in the last fraction of a second of Watto's chance cube roll, late enough so that he can see which side it's
<i>going</i> to land on, but with enough time to spare so that he can subtly and unnoticeably use an ability to change it.

This is the first time any of the players has actually paid attention to the random "alien language" that the GM has been using occasionally to
provide atmosphere and set a scene of an alien world. Our GM is evidently not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conlanger">conlanger</a>.
</p><p>
The language as used in the films is called <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Huttese">Huttese</a>, and is a lingua franca of much of the region
of space in which the movies take place. It was first spoken by Greedo in <i>A New Hope</i>, and based loosely on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua">Quechua</a>, but evolved over the other movies. There is a moderate-sized known vocabulary of
translations of Huttese words and phrases into English, but it isn't as complete a language as, say, Tolkien's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenya">Quenya</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language">Klingon</a>. (The previous sentence
is not meant to imply that Tolkien invented Klingon. If only I'd written it in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban">Lojban</a>,

is basically ad hoc, with no known rules.

One possible superstition about dice, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">subscribed to by many gamers</a>,
is that if a die rolls badly (for some definition of "badly"), then it is obviously "tainted" and cannot be trusted when the chips are really down.
There's also the idea that some dice are "hot" or "lucky" and will have a better chance than others of giving you the results you want. If you are
lucky enough to possess such a hot die, you must be careful that nobody else ever uses or even touches it, as that will "rub the luck off".
Gamers can have many quirks about how they treat their dice.
</p><p>
As pointed out so clearly in <a href="http://laeren.zoggins.net/rpg/dice.shtml">this essay on dice superstition</a>, if dice are random, then it
<i>doesn't matter</i> if you're superstitious about them. But if they're not... well, you <i>better make sure you do the right thing and treat them properly</i>.
No use taking risks now, is there?
</p><p>
Pete, being the highly logical, calculating person he is, rejects all of that as superstitious nonsense. He instead applies the scientific approach.
Over the years, he's collected somewhere around a thousand twenty-sided dice. Every so often, he gathers them all together. He sits down at a table and
carefully and individually rolls each of the thousand dice, once. Of course, roughly a twentieth of them will roll a one. He takes those
fifty-odd dice and rolls them a second time. After about an hour of concentrated dice rolling, he'll end up with around two or three dice that have
rolled two ones in a row. He takes those primed dice and places them in special custom-made padded containers where they can't roll around, and carries
them to all the games he plays.
</p><p>
Then, when in the most dire circumstances, where a roll of one would be absolutely disastrous, he pulls out the prepared dice. He now has in his hand
a die that has rolled two ones in a row. Pete knows the odds of a d20 rolling three ones in a row is a puny one in 8,000. He has effectively pre-rolled
the ones out of the die, and can make his crucial roll with confidence. Furthermore, being scientific about it means he knows that it doesn't matter <i>who</i>
rolls the die for the third time, so he has no qualms about sharing his primed dice with other players, if that's what it takes to avoid disaster.

Many of you probably know <i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>. If not, and you are familiar with
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> or roleplaying games, you might enjoy it. If you are familiar with both, you <i>will</i> enjoy it.
</p><p>
Basically, Shamus Young, the creator, has treated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> as the fantasy campaign of a long-suffering Dungeon Master saddled with all too
typical players, and illustrated it in the form of a comic using screencaps from the movies. Brilliant idea, and very well done. And I constantly boggle that
(a) nobody did it before, and that (b) nobody has copied him yet.
</p><p>
Alas, <i>DM of the Rings</i> has recently come to an end, having told the story to the ending. Shamus has moved on to a
<a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/comic/default.aspx?c=14">new comic project</a>, which involves a collaboration with an artist. So no more movie screencap
comics from Shamus. This has led to a call from his legion of fans for someone, anyone, to fill the void:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Shamus:</b><br>
Which reminds me: This comic is popular enough that I'm surprised nobody else has done something similar. Harry Potter? Aliens? Spider-Man? X-Men? Star Trek?
Star Wars? The Matrix? There are tons of movies which are well known and take themselves very seriously, which are the two main ingredients for good satire.
I keep expecting another movie comic to appear someplace, but it hasn't happened yet.
</br></p><p>
<b>Adam Bloom:</b><br>
I think it's because the kind of person who thinks, "It would be funny to make a comic that spoofs Star Wars" is the kind of person who would read the amount
of work you put into each comic and say, "OMFG WAT???"
</br></p><p>
Whereas the kind of person who thinks, "I want to spend time and effort to make a high-quality webcomic" is not the kind of person who says, "It would be
funny to spoof Star Wars."

You are the rare, and wonderful, exception.

For some reason, game sessions always seem to end in the middle of a huge action scene, which then has to be picked up again next time the gamers meet.
Of course the fact that relatively short action sequences tend to be played in excruciating detail with zillions of die rolls - compared to the boring
"character social interaction bits" which are often glossed over in a few sentences - might have something to do with it.

That helmet Anakin is wearing somehow manages to be simultaneously incredibly dorky, and amazingly cool, in totally different ways.
</p><p>
The pod race in the film suffers from a common trope, in which characters needing to go somewhere really fast head off in their vehicle. At some point they realise they're not going to make it in time, so they open the throttle all the way and go even faster. The question of course being why weren't they going as fast as they possibly could already?
</p><p>
<i>Star Trek</i> provides many prime examples:
</p><p>
<blockquote>
<b>Medical Officer:</b> These medical supplies are needed on the plague planet, urgently!<br>
<b>Captain:</b> Warp 4!<br>
later...<br>
<b>Science Officer:</b> Because of various complications, we might be Too Late.<br>
<b>Captain:</b> Warp 9!
</br></br></br></br></blockquote>
</p><p>
(In fact the writers recognised this problem during <i>The Next Generation</i> era and imposed a
<a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Warp_drive">speed limit of Warp 5</a> on routine operations, with the justification that higher speeds damaged
the very fabric of space-time. A classic example of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown">plot-driven technology failure</a>.)
</p><p>
Anakin's pod is demonstrably faster than any other pod in the race, as seen by the fact that it overtakes and/or catches up with them all with ease. Yet there are also scenes in which we see Anakin and some other racer zooming along side by side for several seconds, with neither gaining significant ground. If Anakin's pod is so much faster, why is he restricting himself to the same speed as his competitors for large chunks of the race?
</p><p>
A potential reason is that he has a limited reserve of "overdrive", capable of giving him short spurts of acceleration, but not enough to allow him to simply go faster all the time. You could handwave that this is what happens in the film, but that's a bit unsatisfying as the reasons for seemingly illogical behaviour should at least be hinted at in fiction, rather than relying on the audience to make post-hoc excuses for the writers. 
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 106</h2>


<p>
The whole pod race sequence was difficult for us to write. Of course, you all know that Anakin wins the race. There wasn't much we could really do to mess
with that, so we were restricted to playing around with how he got there. Building suspense is really hard when you know that the audience knows in advance
how things will turn out.
</p><p>
So we used the race scenes to address some of the logical and plotting problems of the race sequence in the movie, to advance our own metaplot, and
finally to try to create some new tension and suspense that wasn't present in the original. It was a tall order, but we're pleased with how it has come
together.

<p>
We know there's not much happening in this one, but after that epic race, we just felt like really going to town on the celebrations.

One interesting detail is that the circular screen to the right of the commentators is showing a graphic of Anakin. Although one wonders where they got
that from, given that Anakin was only a last minute entry in the race - in the movie too, not just in our version, although in the movie he wasn't
actually <i>replacing</i> Watto.

It's tricky roleplaying bargaining in a game. At least in the real world you actually have some sort of idea about the values of the items
you're trading. (Or you should, or what are you doing bargaining in the first place? Trust us on this one.)
</p><p>
But in a game you're often doing things like trying to get a better price in silver nobles for a magic sword, two scrolls that may or may not be cursed,
and an ox-cart with four oxen. Where do you even begin? The kind GM will play the merchant so as not to rip you off too badly, but really, if the NPC
you're selling to offers you 230 silver nobles, what's your best response? No matter <i>what</i> your counter offer is, you risk being laughed
at for demanding an exchange ridiculously in your own favour, laughed at for being such a dupe and not realising the true value of your goods, and
then additionally not being sure exactly why it is that you're being laughed at.

Intriguingly, a lot of them are automatically generated fake blog spam sites, which farm Google's hot trends for frequently searched terms in order to

I think we owe it to the world to sustain and propagate this insanity. So if you haven't done it yet, go to Google and search for "Jar Jar, you're a genius"

Make posters proclaiming Jar Jar's genius and stick them up all over town. (If anyone actually does this, send us photos and we'll show them off!)

And thus we finally reveal the name of Annie, who played Shmi and is now playing Anakin.
</p><p>
It is long overdue in one sense, but it's come about this way through various contrivances and happenstances. We knew all along that we wanted Annie to end up
playing Anakin. But we introduced her as playing Shmi, because Shmi had a meatier role which lined up better with how we wanted to characterise Annie initially.
Then we went through the whole bait-and-switch ploy where Annie began playing Anakin during the pod race, but then didn't show up for the next game session.
Throughout this, we didn't want to give the game away that she <i>would</i> eventually end up playing Anakin. And of course giving her name as Annie would have
been a complete give-away. So we had to obscure it.
</p><p>
(Okay, there was another option, which was to give her a different name. But, in all of our discussions of the story background from day one, we had always referred
to her as "Annie", so using another name would have seemed strange to us.)
</p><p>
We had originally planned to reveal her name in <a href="/episodes/0117.html">strip #117</a>, with the line, "It makes sense if you play Anakin from now on, Annie."
But before that episode went to air, we wrote this episode. And we realised that the introduction of Anakin to Obi-Wan was a much more natural place to
drop in her real name.
</p><p>
There is one small objection that might come up with the name "Annie". It's clear that the names of Ben and Jim are related to the names of their
characters, Obi-Wan ("Ben" as he is called in <i>Episode IV</i>) Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn. However they made up their own character names, so it's not unreasonable
for there to be some connection. But the GM invented Anakin's name, before he even met Annie (<a href="/episodes/0061.html">strip #61</a>). So the fact
that Anakin's name is similar to Annie's is something of a strange coincidence.
</p><p>
We know that in the story this is a coincidence. But it's a fairly minor one, and coincidences actually do happen sometimes, so we're okay with that.

Some players will nitpick about the tiniest details of a setting, complaining endlessly, for example, how unrealistic it is to have a type of
armour called "splint mail", which never existed in real history, blah blah blah, when the thing wearing it is an <i>orc</i>. Or how a
coinage system based on large quantities of more or less pure precious metals is completely economically unsustainable, while ignoring the fact that
there are literal miracle-working priests and wizards running around the countryside. Or that nobody ever seems to be <i>sick</i> in a society
with no concept of personal hygiene, yet are perfectly happy to accept that dragons fly and breathe fire and masquerade as human beings.

There comes a point where the GM has to subtly remind the players what they were <i>supposed</i> to be doing, what they've so far ended up

At some point it becomes necessary for someone to fill in the new player on what's happened in the game already, and what the characters' mission

Game Masters have to tread a careful line when doing plot exposition. If you don't give enough information, the players will ignore the obvious plot
hooks and go off and do something completely irrelevant to the campaign plans. If you give too much information, they get all excited about actively
dealing with what is meant to be mere background events designed to give the impression that there is a wider world beyond the PCs.

<p>
We haven't shown the GM giving any explicit descriptive background (as distinct from NPC dialogue) for several strips now. We could spend a lot of space
with GM narrative boxes saying things like:
<blockquote>
While you stand on the balcony, overlooking the horizon-wide sprawl that is Coruscant, with vast fleets of transports plying carefully delineated
criss-crossing commuter routes above the towering art-deco skyscrapers, the blazing orange sun sets slowly, painting the sky in a glorious array
of warm colours, which bathe the scene in a spectacular glow.
</blockquote>
But really there's no need, since you, the reader, can <i>see</i> that that's what happening. And we think it's far better for readers to see the
pictures than to have to read masses of descriptive text that (a) cover up the pretty scenery, (b) merely tell you what you would be looking at anyway if only
the text boxes weren't covering it up, only in less detail since a text description can never convey everything in an image, and (c) interrupt the
flow of the dialogue.
</p><p>
So that's why we don't do it. You should, however, understand that the GM <i>is</i> actually describing these scenes to the players, so that they
are aware of the things that we can see in the images. We're just using the convention that we don't have to explicitly burden you with the GM's
lengthy scene-setting descriptive prose. (This also explains how Obi-Wan knew there were no railings in <a href="/episodes/0128.html">Episode 128</a>.)

Getting into an argument with the GM is a sure way of destroying a game. Unless you do it completely in character. Or at least can plausibly
claim that you were in character the whole time and merely arguing with an NPC, not directly with the GM. To Annie of course, this isn't
a problem, but the GM may be learning something here.

Ben is very firm on the concept of player/character separation. There are certain things that he, as a player, knows, but that Obi-Wan, the character,
cannot know given the progress of the story so far. And if Ben knows something but Obi-Wan doesn't, he's not sharing it with the other characters, no
matter how important it is.
</p><p>
Of course to some roleplayers - &lt;cough&gt;Pete&lt;cough&gt; - maintaining this sort of faithful separation is not only silly but tantamount
to character suicide. Player knowledge is an important tool to be used to maximise the effectiveness and success of your character.
</p><p>
On the other hand, despite Pete knowing this vital piece of information all along, he figured it was superfluous to the more important task of getting
cool weapons and generally causing mayhem on a desert world that they'd never be returning to.

Ah, the sepia-toned flashback sequence.
</p><p>
There are several scenes in the movie that take place between NPCs, with no PCs present. Since none of the players are there to witness them, we've
been skipping over them, and the players remain unaware of any of those events.
</p><p>
However, at some point we actually wrote dialogue for this confrontation scene in the Senate between Queen Amidala and Chancellor Valorum. And we thought
it was simply too good not to show. So we're using it here as a flashback, as Senator Palpatine reports to Queen Amidala. Jar Jar is in the room for
this scene (as seen in the previous strip), so it's fair enough that the players are privy to this exchange between the Queen and the Senator. The GM
then uses the opportunity of the two NPCs talking to one another to perform this little piece of flashback plot exposition for the benefit of the players.
</p><p>
Oh, and by the way: Mmmmm... ice cream...

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">ROT13</a>, for those who don't know, is a simple method of encoding text which consists of replacing
letters by letters 13 places away in the alphabet. So "Monk", for example, becomes "Zbax".
</p><p>
ROT13 is a popular encoding for text that is intended to have some minimal level of protection against accidental reading, without actually
preventing anyone who <i>wants</i> to read it from doing so, such as movie spoilers. It's convenient because if you apply ROT13 to a ROT13 encoded text,
you get back the original text - so you only need a single algorithm for both encryption and decryption. Of course, it has become popular enough
that certain people of a certain level of geekiness can now simply <i>read</i> ROT13 text without even bothering to decode it.

In a bizarre twist, "Monk" in ROT<i>16</i> is "Ceda". Maybe Qui-Gon knows more than we think...

If there's one trap that every GM falls into at some point, it's getting into a topic that one of the players is a genuine, certified

that nobody but a genuine, certified expert would even <i>notice</i> - and the player will pull you up on it, and go into great detail about just
how amazingly, blindingly <i>wrong</i> you are.
</p><p>
Vergence (which is used in the movie) is indeed a real scientific term. In fact, it has a few different meanings in fields such as

Unfortunately, as a GM, there's nothing you can do to avoid this problem, since RPG players tend to have diverse and obscure interests and

Many people have considered the idea of bringing "Balance to the Force" as silly, because that (they assume) would mean balancing the Light Side and
the Dark Side. In other words, <i>increasing</i> the amount of evil in the Galaxy, since during <i>The Phantom Menace</i> it is mostly still good.
Obviously, if this was what was intended by this phrase, that's just stupid.
</p><p>
According to George Lucas, in a documentary released before <i>The Phantom Menace</i> was made:
<blockquote>
<p>
Anakin Skywalker, a young boy who is destined to be a significant player in bringing balance back to the Force and to the Republic. [...]
</p><p>
Which brings us up to the films 4, 5, and 6, in which Anakin's offspring redeem him and allow him to fulfill the prophecy where he brings
Balance to the Force by doing away with the Sith and getting rid of evil in the universe.
</p><p>
— <i><a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Balance_of_the_Force">quoted in Wookieepedia</a></i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
So it is meant to be the <i>existence of evil</i> that is the imbalance, and restoring balance involves defeating and eliminating the evil. Which makes
a whole lot more sense. Unfortunately the choice of phrasing turned out to be ambiguous and easily misinterpreted.
</p><p>
Here, we're inverting it by having the GM use the other meaning of Balance, and Qui-Gon's misinterpretation be what was actually intended in the original.

actually start rolling dice and stopping to check if that +2 attack modifier counts in an off-balance situation when performing

potato chips, other assorted snack foods. The pairing (sugar, fat), while perfectly valid - e.g. cakes, doughnuts, ice cream - is not seen anywhere

No seriously, have you ever seen a sheet of paper in any of the <i>Star Wars</i> movies?
</p><p>
That's because there <i>aren't any</i>!
</p><p>
This was such a significant fact that the writers of the first edition of
<a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Roleplaying_Game">Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game</a> went to great pains to point out
that there is no such thing as paper in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, and make sure that players were aware of the effects this would have on
proper characterisation in the setting.
</p><p>
I vaguely recall seeing somewhere that this was a deliberate creative design decision by George Lucas, the idea being that the lack of paper would
help make the setting seem more alien. Which when you put it that way doesn't sound so stupid. Taking the functional place of paper are such things as

The GM here is subtly making the point that this NPC can't actually talk in the middle of a fight because he's distracted by the, you know, fighting.

Actual conversation we had while writing this scene:
<blockquote>
<p>What does Darth Maul look like without his face paint?</p>
<p>The same as Toad in <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120903/">X-Men</a></i>.</p>

We debated at some length having the explosions be silent in space, because of course sound doesn't travel through a vacuum. But in the end we decided to go
with the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>, and have sound effects anyway. It's <i>Star Wars</i>, fer
cryin' out loud.
</p><p>
There is, by the way, for anyone who doesn't know, a canonical explanation for how space fighter pilots can hear stuff going on in space around them.
In the novelisation of <i>A New Hope</i> (or simply <i>Star Wars</i> as it was titled then) - the very first <i>Star Wars</i> thing ever published,
yes, even before the movie - Han Solo explains to Luke Skywalker:
<blockquote>
Your sensors'll give you an audio simulation for a rough idea of where those fighters are when they're not on your screen. It'll sound like
they're right there in the turret with you.
</blockquote>
And you know, when you think about this, it makes a lot of sense. Sensors should be able to detect stuff flying around outside your field of view, and
what better way to present that information to a fighter pilot than to generate a simulated audio field which accurately portrays the spatial
location of things you can't see? Several other science fiction authors have used the same concept.

Trying to find out what these force fields are canonically supposed to be, I stumbled upon the fact that the place where this fight scene

for the capital city of Naboo. And they built it <i>right next door to the royal palace</i>.

You really have to wonder why else, in the middle of a space battle, the Trade Federation would allow an enemy fighter to simply fly straight into
the main hangar on their headquarters ship. Clearly it's being stationed with conscripts or reluctant recruits who never knew what they were signing up for.
</p><p>
[ Note added: There's been some confusion over the "fact" that the droids have been conscripted or recruited. Please be aware that what we say in these annotations is not canonical information within the comic itself. Watch:

Mace Windu is obviously Qui-Gon's long-lost twin brother.

Yes, we think the idea of droids being conscripted or recruited into an army is silly too. That's why we mentioned the idea in the annotation to this strip - to poke a bit more fun at the movie. But if the idea is that silly, you can rest assured that it is <i>not</i> the canonical explanation within our comic.

Sometimes when running a game you can just handwave the dice rolling part and do whatever makes most sense in a dramatic or storytelling context.
Let the heroes win, against any odds. But sometimes, for the sake of uncertainty and dramatic tension, you want to let something ride on the dice.
</p><p>
The result might not be what the players want to happen, but often moments like this are looked back on fondly in later years. Failure can be as
dramatic and memorable as success. The dice provide the means to fail, where a hero would normally succeed. The chance of failure makes success
more sweet, but carries this price.

Of course there's all sorts of things wrong with the idea that blowing up the moon will prevent the geysers from erupting on time. Beginning
with the idea that the moon can cause geyser eruptions in the first place... But never mind that.
</p><p>
Take Earth for example. If you blow our moon up <i>a little bit</i> - just enough to bust it into pieces - it won't have any major effect on the tides.
The centre of mass of the moon fragments will still be in the same place, and that's what really matters. If you blow it up a bit more - enough to
bust it into pieces that fly apart fast enough to overcome their own mutual gravitational attraction and spread throughout Earth orbit - you will affect
the tides, but not immediately. It'll probably take a few days for them to settle into a new pattern. If you blow the moon up <i>even more</i> - enough to
send the pieces flying away from the vicinity of Earth altogether - you'll eliminate tides on Earth, but again it'll take some time for the effects
to settle down. You certainly won't notice the tides doing anything weird in the next couple of minutes. If you blow up the moon with
<i>ridiculous amounts of sci-fi technobabble</i> - say instantly convert the entire mass into energy, or send it into another dimension or something -
then the forces that generate the tides will vanish instantly, but the inertia and momentum of all that water sloshing around Earth's oceans isn't
going to stop suddenly. It'll probably be hours to days before you'd even notice, if you were only measuring the tides and not checking to see if
the moon was still there by other means.
</p><p>
And because we're blowing up moons, it would be remiss of us not to mention:

This is a GMing technique that can work wonders in many games. Make sure you have stuff happening in the background, that the players don't know about, but
that intersects with what they're doing. NPCs have goals and plans too, and are running around doing things independently of the PCs, except for where
their paths happen to cross.
</p><p>
If you do this well, you can create an immersive world where all actions have consequences beyond what the PCs immediately learn, but which remain
consistent with the actions of NPCs and can be revealed later. If you do it <i>really</i> well, you can spring something like this on your players, where
basically everything they did in the entire adventure to date turns out to be at cross purposes to what they should actually have been doing. Just imagine
the look on their faces when you reveal a back story like this.

You have to give something to George Lucas. He really knows how to make the climactic situation of the movie seem utterly hopeless for the heroes
on multiple fronts at the same time. By this point in the movie, the droid army has conquered the Gungans, Anakin is about to get captured or worse
on board the Trade Federation headquarters ship, Qui-Gon is dying, Obi-Wan is hanging on for dear life by fingers that are just about to give out,
and Padmé has been captured by droids inside the palace (although we haven't shown that since there are no PCs with her).

Of course players sitting around the same table playing a game are going to be saying stuff that sometimes the characters being played by the players
right next to them are not aware of. As a GM, there are a few ways to deal with this:
<ul>
<li>You can enforce strict rules and separate the players so they can't communicate when their characters are out of contact.</li>
<li>You can insist that players write down anything that should be secret from other characters and engage in note-passing to communicate with the GM.</li>
<li>You can trust the players to faithfully separate player and character knowledge, and play their characters as if they don't know what the other
players are thinking.</li>

Think about it. It makes perfect sense for the Gungans to mount an offensive against the humans of Naboo at this point. They have their entire army
assembled and ready to march. The Naboo are weakened and shell-shocked by the Trade Federation occupation. And, boy oh boy, they are completely
not expecting it.
</p><p>
And what have the humans ever done for the Gungans anyway? Invaded their home planet and forced them to live in secrecy? Brought powerful enemies with them
who then also attempt to invade the Gungan homeworld?
</p><p>
When you really consider it carefully, the question is why would the Gungans <i>not</i> attack the Naboo at this point? Especially when they would
make such a good food source. The only possible answer is that they're too easily distracted...

Roleplaying games are, in some sense, all about getting to make decisions in the game world that you never get to make in real life. Decisions that are really
important. Decisions that can change the course of history.
</p><p>
The PCs are the people driving the story. What they decide to do <i>really matters</i> to the people around them.
</p><p>
As a GM, it's good if you can really underline this point at some stage during an adventure. Make them acutely aware of the import of what they are
about to decide. Make it painfully clear that the lives of thousands, or millions, or even billions of people will be affected by this decision. And
make it a really tough one. Back the characters into a corner against their morals (alignment is a handy tool here). Throw them on to the horns of a dilemma.

The fact that characters live or die on the whims of dice is one of the more odd things about roleplaying, if you look at it from an actor's
perspective. But as Sally has learnt, the uncertainty is part of what makes it so intriguing. Most people don't want to risk a 1 in 20 chance of
death in real life just in order to have a bit of adventure.

Roleplaying games are all about creating a shared story that seeks to emulate the heights of epic fiction. A senseless character death where the
person in question doesn't get to do something dramatically satisfying is a waste of effort. So this is a rule often used by roleplaying groups:
If a character's death is inevitable (or indeed has already "happened"), they are granted licence to utter "dramatic last words". They can't
materially affect the game, but they can provide a satisfying moment of revelation, drama, or mystery, which adds to the group experience.

One of the perennially difficult parts of a roleplaying campaign is explaining the sudden appearance of new characters mid-adventure, when they
are needed for the metagame reason that the player's previous character has died, and the player needs something to do.
</p><p>
This can get particularly problematic in confined environments, or other places where even <i>coming across</i> anyone else (who's not out to kill you)
is unlikely in the extreme, like deep in a dungeon.
</p><p>
In cases such as this, it pays to have a few handy NPCs floating around that the bereft player can take over until such time as a more suitable
replacement can be logically integrated into the adventure.

Many of you probably know <i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>. If not, and you are familiar with
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> or roleplaying games, you might enjoy it. If you are familiar with both, you <i>will</i> enjoy it.
</p><p>
Basically, Shamus Young, the creator, has treated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> as the fantasy campaign of a long-suffering Dungeon Master saddled with all too
typical players, and illustrated it in the form of a comic using screencaps from the movies. Brilliant idea, and very well done. And I constantly boggle that
(a) nobody did it before, and that (b) nobody has copied him yet.
</p><p>
Alas, <i>DM of the Rings</i> has recently come to an end, having told the story to the ending. Shamus has moved on to a
<a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/comic/default.aspx?c=14">new comic project</a>, which involves a collaboration with an artist. So no more movie screencap
comics from Shamus. This has led to a call from his legion of fans for someone, anyone, to fill the void:

<blockquote>

<b>Shamus:</b><br>
Which reminds me: This comic is popular enough that I'm surprised nobody else has done something similar. Harry Potter? Aliens? Spider-Man? X-Men? Star Trek?
Star Wars? The Matrix? There are tons of movies which are well known and take themselves very seriously, which are the two main ingredients for good satire.
I keep expecting another movie comic to appear someplace, but it hasn't happened yet.
</br></p><p>
<b>Adam Bloom:</b><br>
I think it's because the kind of person who thinks, "It would be funny to make a comic that spoofs Star Wars" is the kind of person who would read the amount
of work you put into each comic and say, "OMFG WAT???"
</br></p><p>
Whereas the kind of person who thinks, "I want to spend time and effort to make a high-quality webcomic" is not the kind of person who says, "It would be
funny to spoof Star Wars."

Canonically it was <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bail_Antilles">Bail <i>Antilles</i></a> of Alderaan who ran against Palpatine in the election
for Chancellor, not <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bail_Prestor_Organa">Bail <i>Organa</i></a>. However there
has been some confusion about the two characters, exacerbated by the fact that both appeared in the original shooting script for
<i>The Phantom Menace</i>, but Bail Organa was cut from the movie and the actor originally meant to play him (Adrian Dunbar) never appeared on screen.
The role of Bail Organa was then recast for <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, giving Jimmy Smits the role. Adrian Dunbar went on to represent Bail Antilles
in various <i>Star Wars</i> Expanded Universe products, which confused some fans familiar with his original casting into thinking that the characters

One of the most potent weapons in the GM's arsenal to make sure the players don't do something incredibly stupid and dangerous that could easily

There are a few screwy things about this part of the movie. Firstly, why the heck <i>does</i> the assassin use such a bizarre method as poisonous
centipede-things? Surely if it's that easy to sneak a droid close enough to dump something right through the bedroom window of a heavily guarded Senator you
want to kill, it would make sense to use something a little more... I don't know... <i>deadly</i>?
</p><p>
And then once the deed is done, why does the droid return to the assassin, in doing so providing a convenient trail for any investigators to follow?
Wouldn't it make sense to pack the entire droid with enough C-4 to make the MythBusters green with envy and detonate the entire thing right next to
where the Senator is sleeping? So as to provide as few clues as possible? (And, like, actually kill the Senator?)
</p><p>
Not that the assassin is entirely to blame here. Wasn't Obi-Wan, in the movie, not two scenes ago telling Anakin off for being rash and saying they
were there to <i>protect</i> Senator Amidala, not race off on some half-assed investigation? And what does he do when there is a threat? Leaps through
a window to chase down a droid, leaving the Senator behind with no protection but an overly impulsive Padawan and a droid mechanic! (And some handmaidens
and Captain Typho, who completely failed to secure the building against... oh... droids with potentially deadly cargoes who can just fly right up
to the Senator's bedroom, <i>without even being sneaky</i>.)

Shamus Young, in the comic that inspired <i>Darths &amp; Droids</i>, <a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=792">almost went there</a>, but
even his mighty lampooning intellect couldn't bear the thought of dealing with the horror known as the
<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#grapple">Grappling rules</a>, and instead went for a joke based on the much easier to understand
<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm">Attack of Opportunity</a> rules.
</p><p>
Even the publishers of <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> themselves
<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/rg/20050301a">admit that nobody understands the grappling rules</a>! It's right there in the second sentence
on the linked page!
</p><p>
And these rules have been <i>simplified</i> since the glory days of the first edition of <i>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>. A <i>lot</i>.
</p><p>
In those days, despite <i>every single other form of attack in the entire game</i> using a d20 dice mechanic, weaponless combat, split into the unholy trinity
of "pummeling, grappling, and overbearing", used percentile dice. With adjustments of plus or minus 1% and 2% for various conditions such as the
strength and dexterity of both the attacker and the defender, their movements rates, what they were wearing, armour class, shields, each 10% difference
in weight, each 10% difference in height, having a helmet, how fast you were moving at the time of the attack, whether any limbs were restrained,
surprise, amount of cover, balance, footing, star sign, what they had for breakfast that morning, marital status, left- or right-handedness,
and so on and so forth. And then you needed a finite state machine to keep track of changes in position and relative advantage of each combatant as
the fight progressed through a series of ineffable state transitions dictated by the results of the dice roll cross-matrixed with the current
weather conditions and date in the druidical calendar.
</p><p>
Of course this is all just in <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>. Many other game systems are worse. It seems the only constant in the varied and diverse
field of roleplaying game design is that the grappling rules must be the most complicated, impenetrable, and frustrating part of the game. The game system
the players use in <i>Darths &amp; Droids</i> is no exception.

Next time you watch the movie, take a careful look at this scene. Anakin falls off the hovercar before Zam crashes it into the ground.
He falls about 5 to 10 metres to the pedestrian street below, which to most normal people is enough to break several bones, if not be fatal.
But then watch how he lands. His trajectory is almost completely horizontal. He does a roll as he hits the ground and then crashes, sideways, into a
convenient pile of cardboard boxes - perfect for absorbing impacts as every Hollywod stunt person knows.
</p><p>
So, obviously what's happened here is that the gravity field generators have made Anakin's vertical fall perfectly safe - but they haven't done anything
at all about his horizontal momentum, which is considerable since he just fell off a speeding hovercar. The vertical fall is not going to kill him, it's
the horizontal speed when he hits a brick wall. So it's indeed fortunate that that pile of boxes was there for him to <i>roll into after he landed</i>,
rather than simply for him to fall into from above, otherwise he could have been very seriously hurt.

One of the fun things about being a GM is when you play NPCs who are the superiors of the PCs. This is when you can - in character - really let them know

So make sure you write down every little thing they do wrong, every tiny step out of line they take, every rule they bend (or more often smash into

smart, maybe it's obvious that it's not actually as obvious as it appears to be...

Speaking of blockbusters, this comic is being published on the 10th anniversary of the release of <i>Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace</i>.
Yes, it's been <i>ten years</i> since the first of the prequel trilogy hit the screens. Wow.
</p><p>
Although derided by many as a bad thing, we have to celebrate <i>The Phantom Menace</i>. Because without it, we wouldn't be here right now, and you
wouldn't be here reading this comic.
</p><p>
This particular strip, by the way, makes use of another of the deleted scenes in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>. It's just a short scene where
Mace Windu and Obi-Wan exchange some discussion before Obi-Wan flies out to Kamino. The special effects obviously haven't been completed as they
would have been if this scene was used in the film, as you can see if you watch this scene on the DVD. But it's good enough for us.
</p>

<p>
Although this scene appears in the movie, it is quite short. There is a deleted version where this scene carries on for about 15 minutes while they walk
approximately 19 miles from the shuttle landing site to wherever it is they're going, past gorgeous Italianate palatial scenery, with
Anakin and Padmé talking about the politics of Naboo in excruciating, mind-numbing detail. If only they'd talked about their past RPG
campaigns, it would have been a much more interesting scene and they could have left it in.

Whatever happens in a roleplaying game, remember that it's only a game. Just because your friends stab you in the back and run off with your treasure and
your kingdom doesn't mean you should bear a real life grudge and take revenge on them by scratching their car or whatever. It's just make-believe.
It doesn't matter in the real world.
</p><p>
Bottle up your anger. And next time you play a game together, <i>let their character have it</i>. You can't do half the vengeful stuff in reality that you
can get away with doing to their character in a game.

I'll tell you what I know: You can never remind your players too often what they should <i>actually</i> be doing, as opposed to what they

No, wait, that'll never work. Don't be subtle. Hit them over the head with it.

We now launch into a series of deleted scenes from the DVD, showing Anakin and Padme´ visiting Padmé's family on Naboo. These scenes served no
real purpose except to extend the development of the romance between the main characters. They also gave a chance for three more actors to have
speaking parts in a <i>Star Wars</i> movie - only to be cut entirely from the script after filming their scenes.
</p><p>
Imagine having that on your acting resumé. "Played Padmé's sister in <i>Star Wars</i>, only you never got to see me on screen."

<p>
It might seem like a good idea to allow one player to play a few different characters, particularly if they're associated somehow, such as being
immediate family members. The trouble is this suddenly gives a single player multiple voices in character. And if you're multiple people, you can
throw your weight around a lot more, win arguments and votes through weight of numbers, and back yourself up on even the most ridiculous ideas
so that it sounds like everyone agrees with you. On the other hand, the need to do all this in character does mean that your player will have to
at least make some sort of effort at roleplaying in order to gain this advantage.
</p><p>
Very sneaky...

The deleted scene continues.
</p><p>
Hey it's not our fault that the women go to the kitchen to clean up the dishes while the men go outside. That's what they filmed. Yet another reason why cutting
this scene from the film was probably a good idea.

<p>
You have to agree with what Anakin says in <a href="/episodes/0256.html">#256</a> (the relevant line of which was taken verbatim from the movie script):
Naboo really is by far the most beautiful place we've seen. Compare to the desert wastes of Tatooine, or the wall to wall skyscrapers and industrial scenery
of Coruscant. Or to the places we see later in the movies: the Mordor-like mountains and caverns of Geonosis, the frozen deathtrap of Hoth, the gloomy
swamps of Dagobah. Bespin might have nice sunsets, but you'd go nuts living there, not being able to walk outside on the ground. And the moon of Endor
might seem pretty, but you'd have to share it with Ewoks...
</p><p>
All things considered, Naboo is about the only planet that seems like it might actually be really nice to live on. Where everyone has an Italian villa
and the weather is cheerful, and there are lakes and rivers and presumably canals.
</p><p>
Okay, I admit it. Basically all I want from life is to live in a place with a good pizzeria around the corner and a gelateria nearby. I doubt you
can get a decent Neapolitan margherita pizza on Tatooine.

Do you, as a GM, <i>really</i> want to mess with your players' heads?
</p><p>
Don't give them everything they could possibly want. Give them <i>more than they could possibly have imagined you'd ever give them</i>.
</p><p>
Do they want riches? Give them a vast business empire. Do your players want power? Give them control of a large country. Do they want bigger
weapons? Give them an entire nuclear arsenal. Do they want magic? Give them the ability to create and destroy entire planes of existence in the
blink of an eye.
</p><p>
Some players will be appropriately staggered, which is great. Some will, however, simply accept it and immediately see what they can think of to
abuse it. So make it come with lots of strings attached. Lots of complications. Lots of unforeseen problems. With something this big, it really shouldn't
be too hard.

Talking about geology is, in fact, more romantic than the dialogue from the actual movie.

<p>
As a GM you have to take shortcuts in order to populate your game universe with characters for the PCs to interact with. You don't want to invest
hours of time detailing all the stats and abilities of some random NPC who the PCs might meet once and then never see again. Yet you do need to
have some stats handy in case the PCs decide that they really need to negotiate with, steal from, or fight some random character they just ran
across. (Any GM will know that this is not a rare occurrence.)
</p><p>
You can wing it, but it's easier to have some stats written down somewhere. So a good solution is to recycle your NPC stats heavily. If the
street beggar, the shoe salesman, the bus driver, the priest, and the exotic dancer all have exactly the same stats, nobody's really ever going to know.
Well, except that everyone <i>already</i> knows since this is such a common GM trick.

Passing notes to players is a convenient way of informing a player about something that their character knows, but which none of the other characters
know. This leaves it up to that player whether or not their character reveals this information - and how much of the information - to the rest of the party.
This makes for more realistic roleplaying.
</p><p>
It also incidentally ramps up the paranoia level of experienced gamers to incredible levels. Less experienced gamers may not realise this side-effect,
assuming that note-passing is a simple and logical way to communicate relevant information. If you have the right mix of gamers, this can cause
some interesting interactions.

Many GMs ignore weather when running their games. Everything seems to happen on a perpetually fine late spring day when it's never too cold or too hot.

Obi-Wan must have a pretty good saving throw in the movie to avoid getting even slightly singed by that torpedo Jango fires at him. And a backpack-mounted

It's a generally agreed convention that roleplaying characters can converse as much as they like during a combat. Not only does this allow for the
fact that a combat lasting about 20 seconds in game time takes about half an hour to play out by rolling all the dice, it also allows the
antagonists to engage in dramatic revelations or ridiculous taunting, as appropriate. Or both. So take advantage of it.

It's easy to throw monsters and Big Bads at your player's characters, adversaries who will simply do anything they can to kill them as quickly as possible.
They'll use any dirty trick they can, any sneaky means at their disposal, any evil trap for the unwary PCs. They'll outgun them, hit them with their full
strength, spare no expense, and hold nothing back. They'll kick the PCs when they're down. They'll be evil, nasty, rotten, wretched, and downright mean.
They'll make false promises, break their word, engage in extortion, blackmail, torture, and slander. You won't be able to trust them as far as you could spit them.
</p><p>
Which is all well and good as far as it goes.
</p><p>
But if you want to make a <i>villain</i>, give them a sense of honour.

If you make your villains honourable in some small way, there will - <i>inevitably</i> - come a time when they can rub the heroes' faces in the fact that

<i>Lord of the Rings</i> or roleplaying games, you might enjoy it. If you are familiar with both, you <i>will</i> enjoy it.
</p><p>
Basically, Shamus Young, the creator, has treated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> as the fantasy campaign of a long-suffering Dungeon Master saddled with all too
typical players, and illustrated it in the form of a comic using screencaps from the movies. Brilliant idea, and very well done. And I constantly boggle that
(a) nobody did it before, and that (b) nobody has copied him yet.
</p><p>
Alas, <i>DM of the Rings</i> has recently come to an end, having told the story to the ending. Shamus has moved on to a
<a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/comic/default.aspx?c=14">new comic project</a>, which involves a collaboration with an artist. So no more movie screencap

Which reminds me: This comic is popular enough that I'm surprised nobody else has done something similar. Harry Potter? Aliens? Spider-Man? X-Men? Star Trek?
Star Wars? The Matrix? There are tons of movies which are well known and take themselves very seriously, which are the two main ingredients for good satire.
I keep expecting another movie comic to appear someplace, but it hasn't happened yet.

Whereas the kind of person who thinks, "I want to spend time and effort to make a high-quality webcomic" is not the kind of person who says, "It would be

PCs in games often don't have enough character background to even mention family members. Which is a shame, really, since family members
provide all sorts possibilities for storytelling and hooks for hanging adventures on.
</p><p>
So if your PCs don't have detailed family backgrounds, this is a great place for creative GMs to
exploit the gap and <i>give</i> the characters some family. Hey, if their background doesn't say they <i>don't</i> have family, then they
probably do. After all, most people do.

In a sense, effective story-based roleplaying is all about facing up to your actions. Everything you do has consequences after all, so
it should be the same for the characters in a roleplaying game world.
</p><p>
The GM, besides creating the game world and applying the game rules, needs to make sure that your characters have to face the
consequences of whatever they choose to do. Most of the time, hopefully, that's good consequences, because you've done the right thing and
succeeded in defeating evil, completing the quest, slaying the monster, or whatever. But when a PC does something that logically
leads to negative effects, or something that can come back and bite them later, <i>it's the GM's job</i> to make sure that the characters
have to deal with those things later on.
</p><p>
If the GM doesn't enforce this form of PC karma, the game can devolve into a free-for-all, where the PCs can do anything without having to
think about what they're doing and worry about the effects their actions have on the game world. From afar, it might seem petty or vindictive,
but applying consequences is the way to make a game world and the people who inhabit it seem real to the players, rather than just a
background for them to show off against.

The only readily available way for a GM to portray significant NPCs in a distinctive manner is to give them easily identifiable speech patterns.

The <i>Star Wars</i> films are one of the fictional settings that thrives on the idea of presenting tiny snippets of
characters who you're never going to see again. It is, in fact, one of the endearing things about <i>Star Wars</i> - it gives a real sense that
the heroes of the story inhabit a larger universe in which there really are millions of other people going about their business and
intersecting with the heroes only briefly. The background gains depth and realism through this device.

You can do a similar thing in a roleplaying game. However, the interaction level is different, and without the aid of visuals it
can be difficult even getting across to the players that there are minor characters flitting around in the background. Also, too many "name" NPCs
can get confusing. Especially if you're trying to make each one memorable as a character in his own right. Our GM is actually
stretching himself perhaps a <i>little</i> too thinly here.

There's only so long you can hold back on vital information when a PC is surreptitiously spying on a conference between scheming NPCs.
The old standby of guards or security devices handy to spot any such spying activity can easily be circumvented by any party of heroes
worth their adventuring salt.
</p><p>
The other option is to spin the conversation out into tedious chit-chat that has nothing to do with the plot. Any sane player would rather
attempt a frontal attack on a heavily fortified enemy base than to overhear the minutiae of a discussion between important NPCs on the merits or
otherwise of the opera they watched the previous night and whether or not the lead soprano reminded them of their great aunt Hilda.
</p><p>
So if you ever need to prevent a PC from learning something important by spying on a conversation, just recall the most dull conversation
you were ever forced to endure, and replay it for the benefit of your players.

Traditionally, death is cheap in roleplaying games. Characters die all the time.
</p><p>
And if PC deaths are a dime a dozen, NPC deaths go for about two gross a penny.
</p><p>
So to make a character's death have an impact, you need to do something special. Have it happen to a character who's been an integral part
of the scenery of the campaign. Someone the PCs interact with frequently, and get to know. Someone who is always there, helping out, and
who they have helped out in return. Someone who the players have good reason to believe will always be there.
</p><p>
In other words, not someone who appeared for 10 minutes a whole <strike>movie</strike>adventure ago, and then just shows up again after
not being seen for ages, and promptly dies a minute later. (An outstanding character roleplayer can cope with this, but those are about
$50,000 a pop.)

Giving players skills in different languages is a good way to give a game world more verisimilitude. Especially if they are from different
cultures or are different species (or some of them are robots). Relatively insular cultures like the elves and dwarves in most fantasy
setting are unlikely to speak the common human languages amongst themselves, after all. And given the evidence of our own history, even
among a single species you can have hundreds of languages within a comfortable horse-ride away.
</p><p>
The problem arises when characters don't share a common language. While amusing for a while, it quickly wears thin, as the players struggle
to communicate with one another underneath the watchful eye of a GM who enforces the fact that they can't just talk. So eventually it devolves
to the point where the mutual incomprehension is conveniently forgotten about.
</p><p>
The point is, really, to let the PCs share a way of communicating. It also avoids the pitfalls that occur when a player decides that,
for once, he's <i>not</i> going to ignore the difficulties and decides to make something of it.

The monologue is the clearest sign of a criminal mastermind. Forget the deathtrap lair in a volcano, the piranha pool for disposing of
substandard underlings, the secret rocket launching facility disguised as an inner city basketball court, the string of nuclear bombs
planted under every hydroelectric power plant on the earthquake-fault-riddled west coast, and the custom built mobile luxury penthouse
in a railway car that sprouts wings and can control the weather. What really, truly makes the villain is the monologue.
</p><p>
No other indicator of mastermindedness or villaininity is so clear-cut and character defining as the monologue.
</p><p>
If you want to make your evil genius stand out above the pack of NPC mook rabble, to tower head and shoulders over the trampled
and betrodden remains of the disposable bad guys thrown into the path of the PCs, to present the impression of pure and implacable
badass to-be-reckoned-with nastiness that will quake your players in their boots and let them know, in no uncertain terms, that this
is the source of all their woes, then you need to compose a monologue of such awesome, such depravity, such unbridled insanity and
in-your-face-ness, that your players will cower before its might and beg to be released from its iron grip once you have begun reading it.
</p><p>
Show them no mercy. This is the villain's moment. He's destined to be defeated anyway - there's no hiding it. But allow him this one
perfect shining example of all that is right about his own deluded way of seeing how the world would be a better place if only everyone
listened to his genius. But of course they don't, and therein lies the tragedy.
</p><p>
For a good monologue not only sets up the villain as the ultimate bad guy, but also provides the hook for sympathy. Because, damnit, he's
actually <i>right</i> about some of the things he's saying. It really <i>would</i> be nice if everyone had a puppy, and people helped
each other get the leaves out of their gutters, and anyone who parked in a disabled spot without a permit was summarily made to defend a
goal for 20 minutes against a wheelchair rugby team. It's just the methods that are wrong: You can't give everyone a puppy by detonating
the entire Pacific Ring of Fire in an attempt to drain the ocean and uncover the lost city of Atlantis so you can retrieve their lost
knowledge and become ruler of the world. (It's not in the Pacific, for starters.)
</p><p>
So use your monologue to impress all of these things on your players. <i>Don't let them interrupt.</i> Or your villain might come across as goofy
as Count Dookû here.

NPC reaction rolls are great if you have no idea how an NPC or group of NPCs might react to something unusual that the PCs might try
to do. You have a table of dice results laid out with entries ranging from "NPC takes extreme offence and immediately attacks" to
"NPC approves heartily and gives standing ovation". Of course some of these would scarcely be appropriate for all encounters, and the
dice roll should be modified according to the roleplaying situation and exactly how things are handled by the player.
</p><p>
The really good thing about them is that they can generate bizarre reactions that lead the story into interesting directions that it
might otherwise not go. Sometimes that can take more adaptabiity to get out of than simply trying to decide what the reaction is without

To enhance the atmosphere of an exploration scene in a game, the GM should be careful never to describe anything that the characters
couldn't notice with their normal senses. There may be secret doors, or rats under the floorboards, or giant spiders lurking in the
dark corners, but if the players aren't poking around in those areas, they shouldn't notice them.
</p><p>
To further improve the experience, make sure you don't describe anything the players don't specifically say they are looking for.
To illustrate:
<blockquote>
<b>Player:</b> What do I see?<br>
<b>GM:</b> A room.<br>
<b>Player:</b> Is there a treasure chest?<br>
<b>GM:</b> You don't see any.<br>
<b>Player:</b> A cupboard?<br>
<b>GM:</b> Not that you can see.<br>
<b>Player:</b> Do I see a wardrobe?<br>

Maps are one of the greatest of GMing aids. A GM can lavish hours on making a beautifully detailed map, showing all the locations and
items of importance and their spatial relationships to one another, along with the positions of important features such as secret doors,
treasures, and traps.
</p><p>
Of course, the players never get to see this wonderful creation. For players you make a crude copy, showing the bare layout of only
the most obvious and gross features. Or possibly you don't show them any map at all, only describing to them in moderately accurate
words the sizes and relative locations of the things they see. Or think they see, as the case may be. And let them fumble around
with a sheet of paper and a pencil, drawing what becomes more and more distorted from the real thing.
</p><p>
The great shame is that probably nobody but the GM will ever see the fully detailed maps. Leonardo da Vinci probably drew fantastic
game maps. And imagine the sorts of dungeon maps M. C. Escher drew. Unfortunately they filed them away in secret places, in the fear
that their players would sneak a peek at them, and so we are bereft of their magnificence.

Let's talk about hit location tables.
</p><p>
If some form of physical peril strikes your character, it can be important to know where on your body it hits. In many cases the
impact is more or less random, so it's not obvious where you've been hit. Enter the hit location table.
</p><p>
This is a table which cross-references the results of a dice roll with various body parts. For example, if you roll a 7, you might get
hit in the torso, a 13 might indicate the right leg, and a 29 could mean the sniper's bullet hit you in the left clavicle. The more detailed
the combat system, the more possible results you can have and the more detailed and specific the body parts can be.
</p><p>
Also, typically a hit in various locations carries with it certain penalties. For example, if you get hit in the leg, it might reduce your
movement rate. If you get hit in the clavicle, it might cause you to drop any weapons being carried in that arm and a 5% chance of bone
fragments severing your carotid artery. You get the idea.
</p><p>
One of the prime hit locations is, of course, the head. It's a nice juicy target, and being hit there can cause all sorts of interesting
side effects. So a high quality hit location table should have a nice, big chance of causing hits to the head. Guaranteed fun for all!

<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">Railroading</a> is the colourful metaphor used to refer to the act of
a GM enforcing a predetermined outcome of an encounter or other plot element on the players, no matter what they try to do. It's generally
spoken of in negative terms, as a criticism of a GM who can't handle the players doing unexpected things to his plot and whatever
planned encounters or places have been created.
</p><p>
But in fact, some level of railroading is almost necessary for most games. Good GMs can "wing it" to some extent, but that taxes the
mental processes necessary for on-the-spot creativity and it is hard to sustain for long with any degree of quality. So most GMs use
tricks that give the players the illusion of doing whatever they want, while really placing the planned obstacles in their path at
convenient spots so they can deal with them. With a bit of flexibility in the precise arrangement or sequence of the planned events,
this actually provides a lot of freedom and to most players this is a satisfying way to run the consensual gaming experience.
</p><p>
So the lesson to be learnt from all of this is that it's of prime importance to <i>tell</i> your players that what they're doing makes a
difference. Even if it doesn't.

Even we couldn't come up with a particularly good reason why Anakin didn't just switch on his laser sword when his hand was trapped, in order to

come up with was that Anakin might have been holding the sword in such a way that if he turned it on, it would slice his own arm off. But just imagine

No GMing style is universally bad. There's always a player who appreciates a particular gaming style.
</p><p>
If you are seeking a new GM and gaming group to play with, and someone says that a particular GM is really good, make sure you know what
that person's preferred playing style is before you accept the review at face value and take the plunge.

If the players have fallen foul of a situation through no fault of their own (say, they had really bad rolls during a combat you expected
them to win, or some other totally uncontrollable circumstance) and end up being captured, then it's fair and sensible to offer them a
relatively easy way out of their predicament. Throw them a lifeline, as it were.
</p><p>
If they take that lifeline and start tying their own nooses with it... well, that's their own fault.

The gladiatorial arena is a staple set piece in fantasy/historical games. Little can compare to the thrill and spectacle of PCs and beasts
in a desperate fight to the death, confined in a small, inescapable space with no cover, and being cheered and jeered by a vast bloodthirsty crowd.
</p><p>
But you need a proper build-up to get the players into the right mindset. Give them time to ponder their fates, plan their tactics, and
anticipate the inevitability of their impending doom. A scene in the tunnel prior to emerging into the roar of the crowd is ideal.
</p><p>
The tunnel scene also gives them the opportunity to attempt an escape by attacking the guards. This inevitably leads to them battling their
way backwards into the arena, where the expectant crowd thinks the very real fight between the prisoners and the guards is all a scripted
part of the entertainment.

When you have a GM like this one, who likes to engage in conversations between NPCs with himself, it often pays to allow these little digressions.
In fact, if you positively encourage them, the GM will eventually run out of innocuous things to say and let slip something really important
for your future progress in the adventure. There's only so much chit-chat you can do before resorting to other knowledge that really should
be kept secret for the time being.
</p><p>
It's a well-known principle of interrogation that the longer you sit quiet and let the other person try to fill the silence, the more likely
they are to start blabbing.

Mass combat is a special case that is often handled differently from the normal combat rules in many roleplaying games. If you tried to run a
fight involving a hundred or more combatants using the detailed one-on-one hand-to-hand rules designed for small encounters, you could be
rolling dice until the cows come home. What you need is a way to give the players something to do while <i>not</i> requiring a bazillion dice rolls
to figure out how many of the vast cast of supporting extras are being incapacitated in the background.
</p><p>
Since mass combats don't actually happen that often, the change of rules can be a little disorienting. At times like these you
need a rules expert on hand.
</p><p>
This goes for both the GM and the players.

<p>
The thing about running a game with a grand plot that plays into the hands of
<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">epic literary tropes</a> is that you don't control what
the players or the dice do. If you're writing a novel or directing a film, you can make the story follow the mythic arcs, because nobody
will be doing bizarre things of their own free will within your story and no random events will suddenly change things without you
being able to do anything about them (without being accused of cheating).
</p><p>
So although you may set up something to generate a brilliant piece of storytelling, always be prepared to have it dashed in a single
moment of unavoidable action by a player.
</p><p>
This is not a tragedy though. For when you <i>do</i> get one of these setups to work, it will be all the more memorable for both you and your
players. The interactive, group-created fiction of a game can be a pale imitation of the best single-author fiction. Or it can tower
over it. You just have to give it the opportunities.

Rousing speeches on the spur of the moment require truly inspired roleplaying. But they can be crowning moments of awesome in a
campaign, if you manage to pull it off.
</p><p>
For this reason, you should keep a notepad of suitably rousing speeches, sorted by context, handy in case your character ever gets
the opportunity to deliver one.
</p><p>
In a personal anecdote, I (DMM) once ran a game in which it became clear that a significant NPC would have the opportunity to
give a rousing speech during a future game session. So I actually did write one. Furthermore, I timed the speech to match a particularly
rousing piece of music - it was many years ago and I honestly don't recall exactly what piece it was any more, but it was timed so the
climax of the speech hit the crescendo in the music. I read the speech out carefully, in time to the music... and it was seriously awesome.

The <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">Arrival of the Cavalry</a> is a time-worn fictional trope. You all know it.
The heroes are beleaguered and staring down the barrel Of Doom, and just in the nick of time the cavalry arrives over the nearby hill to
charge into battle and turn the tide. All very dramatic stuff, and thus its repeated use in all forms of fiction.
</p><p>
The problem in a roleplaying game is that you need to have the cavalry justified in some way, preferably by the actions of the PCs. They need
to have set something up so that they can reasonably <i>expect</i> to be rescued by the cavalry. If they have, all well and good - they probably
deserve to be rescued dramatically at the last second.
</p><p>
If they haven't set it up ahead of time, having the cavalry arrive becomes a
<i><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">deus ex machina</a></i>, and thus an unpalatable method of extricating
characters who really deserve to die through lack of planning.
</p><p>
So if you're playing characters who might need rescuing at some point in the future, <i>let someone know what you're doing</i>. Before
heading off into the lair of the Evil Despot who has been terrorising the kingdom, let the king and his guard know where you're going!
Before launching a frontal assault on the volcanic island base of the League of Extraordinarily Evil Supervillains, send the police an e-mail!
</p><p>
And if you're running a game in which the PCs are likely to do something suicidal - and let's face it, that describes every game, ever -
drop some large hints that it might be good to let their academic friends back at the gloomy New England university know that they're
taking a field trip out to Innsmouth, and to expect them back by nightfall.

It helps to have models laid out to show the scale and relationships between objects during a major battle sequence in a game. The main problem

The chase sequence is always a dramatic part of a story. Will the bad guy get away? Will the heroes manage to catch him?
</p><p>
Good games will have mechanics designed to carry across the excitement of a chase into the game play. Nothing is ever certain,
because obstacles or tactics can mean a slower quarry can evade the pursuers, while circumstances or clever planning may allow
slower pursuers to intercept a faster fugitive. And chases frequently lead to mayhem and collateral damage as bystanders get in the way
and bits of scenery go flying.

In an in-character argument, the characters naturally need to apply the logic of the game world. The logic of the real world, however,
may be very different. Being both a player and the incarnation of a character means you have to weigh your statements doubly carefully to
avoid ridiculous assertions.
</p><p>
This also has application to player versus GM arguments. If the GM strikes down something you want to do on logical grounds, you should
argue that it makes sense <i>in the game world</i>. After all, your character just tried it, didn't he? A character who is familiar with how
reality works in the game world surely wouldn't try something that obviously wouldn't work... so therefore it <i>must</i> work!
</p><p>
And conversely, if the GM forbids you from doing something in the game world,
claim that it's true in real life. After all, your ability to use two guns at once in an arcade game clearly demonstrates that your character
is able to fire double-handed without any to-hit penalties.

Game maps and the terrain they represent can be gorgeous works of art. In more ways than one. Besides being physically impressive or
beautifully illustrated in exquisite detail, they can embody cleverness of design that it takes time and understanding to really appreciate.
</p><p>
A dungeon full of monsters and traps can present such an intricate and meticulously crafted puzzle that it forces the act of negotiating
it successfully to be a heroic endeavour, for any lesser attempt would be doomed to failure. By forcing the players to surpass and
overcome their own limitations simply in order to survive, you generate the stuff of legend.

Honour, decency, valour, chivalry, upholding oaths, fulfilling vows. These are things we sell cheaply in modern society. Swearing an oath

A roleplaying game gives us the chance to live lives of honour, and to interact in a world where your word is your bond, and people

typical players, and illustrated it in the form of a comic using screencaps from the movies. Brilliant idea, and very well done. And I constantly boggle that
(a) nobody did it before, and that (b) nobody has copied him yet.
</p><p>
Alas, <i>DM of the Rings</i> has recently come to an end, having told the story to the ending. Shamus has moved on to a
<a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/comic/default.aspx?c=14">new comic project</a>, which involves a collaboration with an artist. So no more movie screencap
comics from Shamus. This has led to a call from his legion of fans for someone, anyone, to fill the void:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Shamus:</b><br>
Which reminds me: This comic is popular enough that I'm surprised nobody else has done something similar. Harry Potter? Aliens? Spider-Man? X-Men? Star Trek?
Star Wars? The Matrix? There are tons of movies which are well known and take themselves very seriously, which are the two main ingredients for good satire.
I keep expecting another movie comic to appear someplace, but it hasn't happened yet.
</br></p><p>
<b>Adam Bloom:</b><br>
I think it's because the kind of person who thinks, "It would be funny to make a comic that spoofs Star Wars" is the kind of person who would read the amount
of work you put into each comic and say, "OMFG WAT???"
</br></p><p>
Whereas the kind of person who thinks, "I want to spend time and effort to make a high-quality webcomic" is not the kind of person who says, "It would be
funny to spoof Star Wars."
</p><p>
You are the rare, and wonderful, exception.

<p>
See, if you're reading this comic but have never played a roleplaying game, <i>this</i> is why gamers have those collections of more
dice than you think they can possibly use. Because in the heat of battle, the dice <i>will</i> roll off the table and under the sofa.
</p><p>
Some gamers adopt a rule of "play the dice as they lie". But this can cause inconvenient pauses in play while everyone scrambles
under the furniture to confirm whether the fireball did 28 or 37 points of damage, or the dwarf made his saving throw. Indeed, if a die rolls
under something like a refrigerator, it can involve major moving work to observe the die without disturbing the number rolled.
</p><p>
The saner alternative is to declare that dice that roll off the table are void, and to roll again. And if the voided dice are somewhere
difficult to retrieve quickly, it's better to just have spare dice.
</p><p>
<a href="/fanart/Yoda_Dooku_concept.jpg"><img align="right" height="126" hspace="10" src="/fanart/Yoda_Dooku_concept_sm.jpg" width="150"/></a>
Multiply this by 100 or more rolls in a really exciting combat. So <i>obviously</i> any gamer worthy of the title will have several hundred dice.
It just stands to reason.
</p><p>
As a bonus today we present our original concept art for the Yoda-Dooku fight sequence. This art was done way back in October, 2007, when
we were only up to <a href="/episodes/0011.html">strip #11</a>! This set the concept for the angular, broken panel structure we now use in
all laser sword fight scenes. Yes, we've been holding on to this concept art for two and a half years before the scene in question.

The safest assumption you can make about anything unknown that you see in a roleplaying game is that it's an enemy and you should kill it.
Let's face it, 95% of the stuff you meet is out to kill you, so this is actually a pretty good working approximation.
</p><p>
It saves you all the hassle of trying to figure out if it's going to rip your face off or not before it tries to rip your face off.
</p><p>
And the rare occasion that you're wrong? That's what clerics are for! (Or post-mortem brain-scans, if you're not playing a fantasy game.)

When one player finally <i>gets</i> what their character is supposed to be doing - was supposed to be doing for the whole adventure - and
starts doing it, rather than ignoring all the hints and generally messing up your carefully planned adventure, you can bet it's going
to be too late.
</p><p>
Such is the life of a GM.

<p>
Poisons are the bane of a GM's life. Something small, cheap, virtually undetectable, and that can kill a foe with pretty much no
recourse or chance to overcome the effects, while the attacker is safely in another room, city, or even kingdom, is anathema to
the whole concept of dramatic battles and engaging the enemy fair and square.
</p><p>
So much so that the venerable first edition of <i>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> included a couple of pages of information
about how difficult, time-consuming, and expensive it is to make or buy poisons, how ineffective they are at actually hurting people,
and how if you put them on weapons they basically just slide off and quickly become useless.
The goal of course was to discourage players from wanting to use poison, to avoid all of the game-breaking things that can happen
when you let PCs use it with abandon.
</p><p>
Not that this ever stopped anyone from wanting to try it.

Major events in your campaign should be given cool and dramatic names, much like significant events in the real world. It adds atmosphere to
be able to talk about The Rain of Shattered Glass, or The Battle of The Fire Giant's Ravine, or The Maelstrom of Chaos.

Just be careful who you give naming privileges to.

<p>
There are usually some leftover details to attend to at the end of an adventure. These generally involve game mechanical things like healing wounds,
dividing up the treasure, and awarding experience points.
</p><p>
But sometimes the players have character development things they want to handle. If there's going to be a break before the next adventure in
the ongoing campaign, then they may want to arrange for their characters to study skills, research spells, or travel to foreign places.
In general, it's good to allow this sort of thing.
</p><p>
Sometimes it can lead to surprising things.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 409</h2>


<p>
Ceremonies make good rolepaying occasions. Ceremonies are often <i>mostly</i> scripted events, but with some room for interpretation
by the participants without being the usual free-for-all that characterises most in-game events. This allows players to free themselves
from worrying about what they should be doing and lets them get a bit creative with the small bits that they are allowed to
improvise. It can also give the GM some time to take centre stage and act out a scene of prepared action and dialogue.
</p><p>
Such scenes can make excellent closers for adventures. If the heroes have won the day, have them attend an award ceremony where
the king presents them with a medal or a knighthood. Write some suitably ceremonial dialogue and have the players give formalised
responses at appropriate moments, possibly allowing them to compose part of their original scripts themselves ahead of time, or letting
them react and ad-lib on the spot.
</p><p>
It may not be a huge battle, but it can be just as, or even more memorable. And that's just if it all goes according to plan... You could
also set up the next adventure by having the ceremony dramatically interrupted partway through. Think the ending of
<i>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</i>. Do <i>that</i> to your players, and you can bet they'll come back for more next time you run the campaign.

<p>
As with the end of <i>Episode I</i>, we're having a brief intermission before moving on from <i>Episode II</i> to <i>III</i>.
</p><p>
We know many of you have worked it out by now, but here is the plan the GM drew up for the mysterious fantasy campaign that the
players played in the break between the first two chronicled adventures. (If you're still not familiar with it, this should provide
enough information to Google it up.)
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 411</h2>


<p>
We've <a href="/episodes/0240.html">mentioned before</a> the fact that <i>Episode II</i> revealed that there are shapeshifters in the
<i>Star Wars</i> universe. And the fact that this is interesting and potentially story-altering, because you can never be sure who you are
really talking to.
</p><p>
But <i>Episode II</i> also makes a major plot point out of advanced cloning technology. Combine these two science fiction concepts
and the whole game changes. <i>Anyone</i> could be <i>anyone</i>. Or a <i>clone</i> of anyone, as opposed to the <i>original</i> anyone.
And again, absolutely nothing is made of the potential problems of identity that this interesting concept can cause.
</p><p>
So here's an out-take strip, as part of the between-Episodes intermission.
</p>

Unfortunately, as gaming groups mature there will be occasions when one or more of the regulars can't make it to a game session for various

If the GM says you have "weapons", without specifying exactly what sort of weapons they are, this is of course effectively an open invitation to
use whatever weapons you desire.
</p><p>
The general principle is that vagueness of description is your friend. If the GM didn't specify something <i>precisely</i>, feel free to interpret
it in whatever way is most advantageous for your character. After all, the GM didn't say it <i>wasn't</i> like that! This will either
get the GM tied in knots of legal-level complexity when offering descriptions, to the point where they can't keep things straight any more,
or convince them to simply let you get away with whatever deviousness you have in mind. Either way is a win.

The primary rule of vehicular combat is: <i>You can always ram</i>.
</p><p>
When all else fails, when the weapon systems are offline, when the computer is dead, when the engine is half-crippled, as long as
you can move at all, you can still heave about and crash into your opponent.

In fact, even if your vehicle is totally immobile, a suitably clever player will <i>still</i> find a way to ram it into an enemy vessel.

Giving players command of subordinate troops in a combat situation can be a good way of impressing upon them the seriousness of

Canonically, <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Coruscant_%28Clone_Wars%29">this battle</a> is supposed to be taking place in
the upper atmosphere of Coruscant, not "space". Although the definitions of "upper atmosphere" and "space" are a little fuzzy around the
boundaries. Once you get above about 100 km from the surface of a planet like Earth you're basically in space (in fact that's the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line">usual definition</a>). And even at significantly lower altitudes the air is
so thin that sound won't really propagate easily. When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kittinger">Joseph Kittinger</a>
jumped from a balloon at 31,000 metres, he reported that there was no sound. (This is the highest ever parachute jump, and a fascinating story,
I recommend you read about it.)

Any roleplayer wanting to maximise their chances in strategic-level battle encounters will of course study the classic masters. The Roman Army.

Science fiction and fantasy games present unique opportunities for character interaction. In the everyday world, most objects are inanimate.
In a world with ubiquitous robotic technology, or a world with magic, you can give <i>anything</i> a voice and a personality.
</p><p>
Of course you should not go overboard with this. Only use it when it will <i>really</i> inconvenience or annoy the PCs.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 421</h2>


<p>
And of course if you make normally inanimate objects smart enough to talk, you should expect your players to want to reason with them
and convince them to do what the players want them to do. Gary Gygax, in his infinite wisdom, included a mechanic in the original
edition of <i>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> specifically to prevent PCs from reasoning with intelligent magical swords: the Ego score.
</p><p>
Basically, the more powerful a sword is and the more useful it would be for a PC to be in control of all of the fantastic abilities it
can grant, the more Ego the sword has, the less likely it is to acquiesce to demands to use those abilities, and the more likely it is to
talk back and be generally annoying at the worst possible moment!
</p><p>
Is that the perfect game mechanic or what? Gary, we are humbled by your boundless game mastering genius.

This is about the only sensible explanation for how Anakin destroys these missiles in the movie. He goes into a spin, and the missiles
<i>start spiralling around one another in tight helical paths</i>.
</p><p>
Apparently in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe, homing missile designers totally over-engineer the capabilities of the missiles, until they're
<i>so</i> stupidly precise and accurate that this sort of thing can happen. I guess that's where they put the designers who
start overthinking their designs and adding superfluous features like safety railings on all those bottomless-pit-spanning catwalks.

Battles are messy, particularly ones involving vehicles and artillery. You get bits of shrapnel and wreckage scattered all over the
place. If you're a smart player, however, you can take advantage of this. Use it as cover, or a screen, or a distraction. Scrounge
around and you can find discarded weapons to fill out your equipment list. Or valuable items you can sell for loot later.
</p><p>
If you're a smart GM, you can make bits of the wreckage be unexploded ordnance, or leaking radiation, or other fun things.

<p>
A good GM will use things from their everyday experiences to provide challenges to the players. Stop and think about something that
annoys you or causes you problems in real life. Then think about how you can use elements of that as part of a gaming obstacle or encounter.
Play up the difficulties and frustration to a level where it becomes a serious hindrance or even danger to the PCs.
</p><p>
Imagine sending an Imperial auditor after a successful group of adventurers to go through their treasure and assess taxation. Or having
a group of space traders deal with a full Customs inspection, import licence check, and so on. Or have them kept awake all night when
camping in the wilderness by swarms of caterpillars constantly crawling over their faces.

Firing into melee with a missile weapon. Has there ever been a situation guaranteed to provide more amusement than that?
</p><p>
We mean melee involving at least one friendly character, of course. Firing into a melee made entirely of enemies is no fun at all.
(It's much more amusing to blast the lot with an area effect weapon or a fireball, for example.)
</p><p>
Because everybody just <i>knows</i> that you're going to hit your comrade. It <i>always</i> happens. And yet people try it anyway.
<i>Because it's so much fun.</i> If you hit the enemy, that's fine, you score a hit and do damage, and possibly go on to win the encounter.

When infiltrating an enemy stronghold, the place will of course be crawling with guards. So it makes sense to do whatever you can to
reduce or eliminate the threat before you begin your assault. So flood the castle by magically diverting the adjacent river, or bathe
the installation in gamma radiation.
</p><p>
Just don't reflect too long on the fact that the hordes of faceless NPC guards you're pre-emptively destroying have families and friends.
It's better to sweep that under the carpet than to be forced to encounter and kill them all one by one on your rampaging
expedition. It also gets you all the experience points a lot faster and more efficiently. A mere 20 XP is a tragedy, but 20,000 XP is a

It's always good to have more going on in the background than the PCs are aware of. Having third party events happening around them, regardless of

Often GMs fall back on using only visual descriptions to describe what the PCs can sense. This is a natural tendency, since we are primarily
visually oriented and sight provides most of the information we get from the world around us. But what this means is that referring to
the other senses can provide additional nuance that players often don't get. This is a good way of building atmosphere into a game.
The visual channel is for information, the other senses can be used for little touches that add realism. Describing the sounds and smells
of a foreign bazaar can make it feel much more involving.
</p><p>
Of course you can also use the other senses to provide clues and information as well. This can be a subtle way of hinting at something the
PCs should be picking up on, but may not notice right away because they are more conerned with what they can see. The sounds of voices down
a corridor is a relatively common example, but you can also embed clues in smells - and tastes and touches if you're really clever.
</p><p>
This also goes for any additional senses that PCs might have, be they technological, psychic, or magical. Use them as ways to add
atmosphere to the game, and as potential channels for information that may not be readily visible.

The thing about robots is that once you start treating them as sapient beings capable of being characters (in the roleplaying game sense)
in their own right, they immediately get all sorts of other baggage attached to them that really should only apply to organic beings.

Sometimes it's a good idea to take a bit of time out to think about the events of the game. The plot elements and background information
that the GM has carefully been parcelling out are clues to the grander scheme of things, and taking the time to consider them and figure
out what's happening in the world around the PCs can be time well spent.
</p><p>
Assuming (a) you have the sort of GM who actually <i>has</i> some sort of background plot in mind, and (b) someone in the party isn't

Acrobatics is something you should make the most of in a game. Very few people have the skills to do daring and athletic displays of acrobatics
in real life situations, so this is a good thing to take advantage of in game rules. Games are generally designed for larger-than-life
characters, since that's what's fun to play. It's not much fun playing someone who's no better than you in any way. You might end up
playing a character who is less able than you in one or two ways, but that will usually be more than compensated for by a swollen list of
superior abilities.

During a game, you usually have your character sheet sitting in front of you, so you can record stuff like lost hit points, used spells,
and all the loot you've collected. It can become tempting, when the GM isn't looking, to also record things like improved ability scores,
new skills, and better equipment.
</p><p>
Just make sure that if you <i>do</i> succumb to temptation that you also add balancing features such as reduced scores in other areas or new
disadvantages and flaws. It looks much less suspicious if your character remains - technically, according to a strict, literal interpretation of
the rules - balanced at the same power level as before.
</p><p>
On the other side of the GM's screen, if you're running a game and your players' characters suddenly start sprouting flaws like No Fashion Sense,
Inability to Smell Garlic, or Susceptibility to Hangnails, then you should be keeping a closer eye on their scribbling.

Ah... the truce.
</p><p>
If you ever find yourself in trouble, facing overwhelming odds, doomed to defeat - offer to talk under a banner of truce. Even the most despicable
NPC enemies will stop to listen, because your GM will be astounded that you decided to take this tactic, a tactic that no PCs ever use.
</p><p>
As soon as your foe's guard is down, you strike! The truce can be your greatest weapon.
</p><p>
Oh, and if your GM makes rumbling noises about "playing your alignment", just explain that obviously it's for the greater good, so your paladin

applied during combat sequences. However, there are other situations where spending a significant amount of time discussing character actions
can start to become strange, such as when there really is something important and urgent that you should be attending to.

Occasionally it becomes necessary to introduce or recall characters into the action because of real-world interruptions like starting a new game session
and suddenly having more players in the game. This is why it's good to pause games at convenient stopping points in between adventure
scenes, such as resting at an inn, or during time off work, or between interstellar delivery runs.
</p><p>
Sometimes, however, you're stuck and must break a session during a combat scene, or while chasing a criminal through the city streets, or
while in hyperspace en route to a new planet. That can make things slightly trickier.

start doing instead of gaming are more important than others.

But <i>are they more important than gaming</i>??

Of course, to get the most out of a background setting and story which have been lovingly crafted by your GM, you should be careful and take
detailed notes about any significant events or knowledge that you come across during the course of your character's adventures.
</p><p>
Which means, naturally, that nobody ever actually does it.
</p>

<p>
Character reputations are a great way to keep errant PCs somewhat in line. Reputation isn't as tangible as skill levels or spell lists
or combat stats, so players tend to take less notice of it. In fact, many games don't even track reputation in any way at all.
</p><p>
But in a realistic world, people who go around doing the sorts of things that PCs get up to will attract attention. They'll make the news.
Their fame will spread. Or their infamy, as the case may be. If they get up to nasty or unpopular things, then the public will start to
turn against them. Before long, they'll find they're not welcome at any inn in town, or their money is no good at the local temple
that offers healing (to sufferers they approve of).
</p><p>
And yes, you can even apply this in an undercover game, where the characters should by all rights stay well out of the public eye. If there
was a real life James Bond running around doing the sorts of things he does in the movies, just how long do you think he'd stay a <i>secret</i> agent?

<p>
Because adventures always start with everyone meeting in a tavern, the tavern is a good place for the PCs to scout around for any information
related to the adventure that they're about to embark upon. Of course, the sort of people you'd normally find in a tavern are not exactly
going to be the most reliable source of information on precisely what sort of horrors or treasures await in the nearby evil necromancer's lair*.
</p><p>
Instead, what you get is a hodge-podge of rumours, hearsay, and straight-out fabrications, mixed with <i>just</i> enough grains of truth
to make it impossible for the PCs to dismiss them all outright. This is the perfect opportunity to plant the seeds of paranoia about the
obstacles and horrors that lie ahead, mixed with the tantalising lure of the riches and rewards that await.
</p><p>
Just remember the golden rule: Understate the horrors and overstate the rewards.
</p><p>
* Unless some of the necromancer's staff hang out at the tavern in their off hours. Hey, it happens in the sillier campaigns.

<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Alignment systems</a> in games are attempts to codify the moral
and ethical attitudes of characters into handy labels that can be used with the game mechanics. In other words, to separate the spectrum
of human behaviour into black and white. This provides a handy way to get a handle on conflict in the game. If you're Good, you fight Evil.
Often this extends as far as, "If it's Evil, it's okay to kill it."
</p><p>
In reality, of course, there are <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadesOfConflict">all sorts of shades to conflict</a>.
If you're running a game with an alignment system, try setting up some Good characters who actually oppose what your (presumably Good) PCs
are trying to do. Build conflict not only around the obvious Evil Threat, but also within the factions that ostensibly support what
the PCs are doing.
</p><p>
But be careful. If you go too far with this, you risk turning your game into the Council of Elrond.

Passing notes in a game is kind of like passing notes in class. That illicit thrill of secret knowledge. The in-crowd feeling of

Keeping people safely away from the edge of one of those apparently bottomless shafts that leads to a reactor core? Stopping people from
falling off narrow catwalks that inexplicably span vast chasms for no apparent reason? Around a slippery, water-sloshed platform which

This is the problem with bionics, at least the fantastic supertech sort you tend to get in games. If a bionic hand is stronger and more dextrous
than a regular flesh and blood hand... why would any adventurer want to keep their own hands? A quick trip to your local street doc and you now
have an instant stat boost!
</p><p>
So such things need to come with some sort of game balancing mechanic, to prevent people going off and having limbs replaced at the drop of
a hat. You could make bionic parts no better, overall, than the fleshy part they replace. Perhaps improved dexterity comes at the cost of
reduced strength, like in Anakin's case in this comic.
</p><p>
Or you could make bionic parts incredibly expensive. Although frankly a little thing like lack of cash is never going to stop a determined group of
PCs. It may take a suicide raid on the heavily fortified and guarded headquarters of a multinational tech company to uncover proof of their grey ops
activity in cyberspace in order to set up a blackmail opportunity that leads to being tailed, spied on, and eventually kidnapped and set loose
on the CEO's private tropical island crawling with genetically engineered venomous tigers and man-eating plants in order for the CEO and his
cronies to engage in the greatest sport of all-time - a human hunt - and then escaping by building a trebuchet out of coconut palms and
flinging themselves onto the CEO's luxury yacht, then evading an all-out chase across beach-spangled lagoons to arrive in a port and
sell the yacht and their story for millions... but they <i>will</i> get the money.
</p><p>
Or you can do as some games do and make the acquisition of bionic parts cost "humanity" in some abstract accounting system that keeps track
of how emotionless and mechanically detached the character is becoming from their fellow human beings.
</p><p>
Some players will barely need encouragement. After all, what better excuse can there be for not caring about anyone but yourself?

If you give PCs a chance to have <a href="/episodes/0197.html">dramatic last words</a>, it's only fair that you give significant NPCs that chance too.
Use their last words to set up or reveal something that the players never knew or even suspected about their foes and their evil plans.
</p><p>
<i>Make it so that later on they will want to have kept the villain alive</i>.
</p><p>
In fact, this is a generally good idea. If the PCs kill someone or destroy something, make it turn out to be important for them later on.
</p><p>
With any luck, the PCs will get so paranoid that they'll stop killing bad guys. And then of course you can have them escape and cause
even <i>more</i> problems later on. Win-win!

Of course there arise times when you have to kill someone in a game. Part of the escapism of a roleplaying game is that your character can
do things that you'd never do - or want to do - in real life. The vast majority of us would never wish to take someone's life in reality,
but in a game this is a subject that can be approached in relative safety.
</p><p>
Slaying hordes of evil minions can make the death of an NPC at the hands of a PC into something trivial. But think about what your character
would actually be feeling at the time. A character who is conflicted and wishes he didn't have to kill the NPC, and who mopes about it
afterwards can be a more interesting and believable character.
</p><p>
The downside is that such a non-blasé approach to killing NPCs might make your fellow players think there's something weird about you.

Logic seldom comes into consideration when PCs need to decide what to do. Or at least <i>in-game</i> logic. Any sort of action can be
justified with out-of-character arguments - which is why PCs are so unpredictable.
</p><p>
You can bet when a group of "heroes" are discussing whether to release the orcish women and children, capture them and sell them as
slaves, or simply slaughter them, that the argument will be over which course of action gets the characters more gold and experience,
not which is the most sensible and morally defensible option within the circumstances of the game setting.

Regaining consciousness after falling in battle usually takes place safely in the care of comrades who have successfully beaten off the foes
and secured an area for resting and recovery. Which means you should mix it up a little!
</p><p>
Following the example here, it can be much more fun
if the able party members need to carry an unconscious friend to escape from imminent danger, and then have the knocked out person
wake up in the middle of some situation even <i>more</i> precarious than when they lost consciousness. Just remember that many game systems

There are certain types of players for whom the less you say as a GM, the scarier the situation will be. The more stuff you specifically deny,
the more the player will suspect that there's something hidden and dangerous going on that they can't detect.
</p><p>
This response can be cultivated. Never say, "There are no traps in the room," when you can say, "You don't detect any traps."
Don't say, "There are no orcs around." Say, "There are no orcs visible within the range of the feeble flickering of your torches."
And especially don't say, "It's perfectly safe to rest and regain your strength in the realm of the friendly elves. They tend to your
wounds and give you delicious nuts and berries, and sweet honeyed wine to drink." Say instead,
"The elves <i>appear</i> to be friendly, offering what they <i>claim</i> are healing balms and lotions. You sniff the golden liquid in a
proffered cup, and think you can recognise a faint odour of almonds..."
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 464</h2>


<p>
Of course when you set traps for the PCs to encounter, you have to give them some way of detecting, disarming, or otherwise avoiding the
trap. Or at least the appearance of a way to avoid it.
</p><p>
Conveniently, many game systems specify that - because a character shouldn't know if there is a trap there or not before a successful
detection attempt is completed - the GM should make
the roll to determine if the attempt has been successful, without revealing the actual numerical outcome of the roll to the
player. Ostensibly this is because if the player rolls what is obviously a good result on Detect Traps and the GM says, "You don't find anything,"
that's very different from the player rolling a <i>poor result</i> and being told, "You don't find anything."
</p><p>
The <i>real</i> reason, however, is so that the GM can fudge the dice and declare that the PCs are trapped, even if he actually rolled
really well.

Every party should include a member who is optimised for stealth, or technical expertise, or agility, or healing powers, or

The first meeting with a major villain should be a memorable event.
</p><p>
To achieve this, you need to lay some groundwork. Mention the villain's name well in advance of any expectation of any meeting with the PCs.
Build up the villain's reputation with rumours and hearsay. Let the PCs hear tales of some of the horrible things the
villain has done. Let them see the gruesome aftermath of some of the villain's activities. Have the PCs encounter low-level minions
of the villain, carrying out part of what appears to be some secret master plan. Let them realise slowly just how horrible
that master plan is, and how powerless they appear to be to stop it.
</p><p>
Then when they meet this criminal mastermind have it be on the villain's terms. Have the PCs be helpless to do anything but listen and,
perhaps, talk.
</p><p>
Then have the villain say something that they never expected and which totally blows their minds away. It barely matters what it actually is;
it can be almost anything. The main requirements are just that it's dramatic and unexpected.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 467</h2>


<p>
Villains should use insults when talking to the PCs, of course. But it's difficult coming up with truly inspired insults on the spur
of the moment when improvising the villain's dialogue. So prepare some original and artistically crafted insults beforehand and have them on a
list, ready to pepper into the villain's conversation at appropriate moments. (Like every second sentence.)
</p><p>
The list also comes in handy when telling your players to stop mucking about, quoting Monty Python, or discussing the latest video games,
and <i>play the actual game</i>.

An interesting thing to try to do is to split up the PCs. No, <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSplitTheParty">not physically</a>,
but in terms of what they want to achieve, or even what side they are on.
</p><p>
Normally, the players in a game work together. When they encounter a villain, don't have the villain offer them something that they <i>all</i>
might conceivably want in exchange for not opposing him. Offer something that <i>one</i> of the players' characters will find irresistible.
</p><p>
Divide and conquer. Sow discord amongst the PCs and watch them bicker about whether they should accept the villain's offer or stick together
and defeat his evil plans. The good thing is this barely takes any effort for most groups of players.

If you foresee some particular encounters or situations that will probably occur in an upcoming session, you can prepare some suitable

A regular games night is something like scheduled hedonism. So why drag it down with pizza and chips? Try something a bit more refined
for the evening repast. Wine and cheese works, but you could also have each player bring a dish they cooked and have a proper meal
rather than stuffing your faces with junk food.
</p><p>
Of course, some would argue that junk food is an essential part of the gaming experience! Well, if that's your cup of tea, at least

The villain should always have an escape clause. <i><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Always.</a></i>

The longer you keep them from truly defeating the villain once and for all, the more villainous and epic your creation becomes, until
he ends up going down in the annals of roleplaying lore. This is the guy your players will remember for the rest of their lives. The massed
orcs and giants, and even dragons don't matter if they just end up getting killed and donating their life savings to the PCs' gambling and
wenching fund. The one they'll remember is the one they could never quite defeat.
</p><p>
Until the very end of the adventure, or even the end of the entire campaign. Then you have the Ultimate Showdown. Let the villain make an
<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastVillainStand">epic last stand</a>. Here, you <i>can</i> let the PCs win. But do not
let them <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillHimAlready">simply kill him</a>. Have the fight cause some sort of

</p><p>
Just stop speaking for a while. Sit there and say nothing. Do nothing. It may take a little while, but the players will eventually

One good thing about roleplaying games is that you can expand the in-universe time for dramatic events many times over.

<p>
Probabilities are a great way to express the myriad intricacies and complex interactions that go into producing one particular outcome to a realistically
convoluted situation rather than some other potential outcome. Because no matter how labyrinthine and tortuous the details, in the end it
boils down to a specific chance that outcome A occurs, or doesn't occur.
</p><p>
And when it comes right down to it, frankly, that's all the players really care about. So don't bother justifying potential outcomes with
scientific theories and arguments. Just set a percentage chance, and let them roll. In most cases, your simple judgement alone will be enough to
assign some reasonable number. It's much easier than actually thinking about how stuff works.
</p><p>
But what if you're really not sure what the chance of a particular outcome should be? Some GMs may be tempted to go down the path of
thinking about what's happening in the context of the game, applying a consistent set of game world physical laws, and making some sort
of mathematical calculation. Do not stray to this Dark Side!
</p><p>
So what to do? One game (which Shall Not Be Named for reasons that will be obvious to anyone familiar with it) has a solution to this problem.
If you don't know what the percentage chance is that something will happen, simply roll percentile dice! Not sure what chance that potion flask has
of actually containing poison? Roll percentile dice! There, it has a 37% chance of being poison! Or if you roll 85, it has an 85% chance of being poison!
Then just roll against the randomly generated probabiity to determine if the flask contains poison or not.
</p><p>
Mathematically astute readers will no doubt already be complaining that rolling to determine the percentage, then rolling against that percentage to
see which way the question resolves is equivalent to an <i>a priori</i> 50.5% chance. (It's not exactly 50% because in standard gaming practice
a roll equal to the chance number is considered a success in rolling that probability, not a success/fail tie. But at any rate it's close
enough for our purposes here.)
</p><p>
The much, much, much better rolepaying game of
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toon_%28role-playing_game%29">Toon</a></i> therefore takes the extremely sensible shortcut of
making the <b>Fifty Percent Rule</b> an integral part of the game:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is both impossible and unnecessary to think of everything before the game begins. If you're ever confronted with a totally unexpected
situation or you're unsure about what to do next, use the <i>Fifty Percent Rule: When in doubt, roll it out!</i>
</p><p>
Any time you can't figure out how an
NPC will react to something the characters do, or any time you don't know precisely what will happen next, reduce the situation to a Yes-No
question. Are the keys to the jail cell hanging right next to the cell? Can any of the characters reach the big red button marked "Do not push"?
Does the store have any carrots in stock? Are there any people on the street?
</p><p>
Once you've reduced the situation to a Yes-No question, roll one die. If you roll a 1, 2, or 3, the answer is "Yes". If you roll a
4, 5, or 6, the answer is "No". Shout, roll your eyes, and generally act crazy, and the players may not even notice you've just pulled
something from thin air. This is a really handy rule, so don't forget to take advantage of it.

It can be very difficult making sure your significant NPCs don't turn into a progression of

It's nice, but it's totally impractical as actual sleepwear. You'd strangle yourself with the pearls, if you're not lying on them and getting
the Princess and the Pea effect going. And your arms would be tangled in the huge cape so you couldn't free yourself. Basically, it's a
walking deathtrap. In fact, it's almost <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/cloaker.htm">one of these</a>, as recounted in this tale of woe:
<blockquote>
While delving in the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, old Fingers spotted a rich leather cloak hanging from a peg. While his allies fought off fire
bats, Sticky Fingers plucked the cloak from the hook and threw it over his shoulders. To his shock, the cloak came alive and enveloped him,
killing Sticky Fingers before any allies could help.

Given the number of cursed items lying around in your typical fantasy campaign world, there must be approximately one cursed item for every

Player characters are, often, the movers and shakers of their game world. Perhaps not when starting out on their adventuring careers,
but sooner or later most PCs develop into powerful personalities who can bend the ears of kings, decide the policies of governments, and

Many of you probably know <i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>. If not, and you are familiar with
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> or roleplaying games, you might enjoy it. If you are familiar with both, you <i>will</i> enjoy it.
</p><p>
Basically, Shamus Young, the creator, has treated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> as the fantasy campaign of a long-suffering Dungeon Master saddled with all too
typical players, and illustrated it in the form of a comic using screencaps from the movies. Brilliant idea, and very well done. And I constantly boggle that
(a) nobody did it before, and that (b) nobody has copied him yet.
</p><p>
Alas, <i>DM of the Rings</i> has recently come to an end, having told the story to the ending. Shamus has moved on to a
<a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/comic/default.aspx?c=14">new comic project</a>, which involves a collaboration with an artist. So no more movie screencap
comics from Shamus. This has led to a call from his legion of fans for someone, anyone, to fill the void:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Shamus:</b><br>
Which reminds me: This comic is popular enough that I'm surprised nobody else has done something similar. Harry Potter? Aliens? Spider-Man? X-Men? Star Trek?
Star Wars? The Matrix? There are tons of movies which are well known and take themselves very seriously, which are the two main ingredients for good satire.
I keep expecting another movie comic to appear someplace, but it hasn't happened yet.
</br></p><p>
<b>Adam Bloom:</b><br>
I think it's because the kind of person who thinks, "It would be funny to make a comic that spoofs Star Wars" is the kind of person who would read the amount
of work you put into each comic and say, "OMFG WAT???"
</br></p><p>
Whereas the kind of person who thinks, "I want to spend time and effort to make a high-quality webcomic" is not the kind of person who says, "It would be
funny to spoof Star Wars."

There's an old storytelling maxim:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show,_don%27t_tell">Never <i>tell</i> your audience when you can <i>show</i> them</a>. This applies
equally to conveying information from NPCs to your players. Things will be more entertaining if you can act out conversations, rather
than just having an NPC tell the PCs about it.
</p><p>
Of course there are exceptions in storytelling, when a narrative recap contributes to better pacing than a detailed depiction. And so
there are exceptions in gaming, such as when you get carried away and turn the game into a one-person play.

If your campaign begins in a city on the south coast of a large continent, and you've painstakingly mapped the continent for thousands of miles to

</p><p>
And if you map the ocean, its islands, and all the lands beyond, they'll head underground.

And if you create comprehensive maps of the subterranean system of caverns, tunnels, and lairs that underlies the entire world, they'll

<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleBiomePlanet">Single biome worlds</a> are in some cases justified. There really are
planets where the climate and terrain is pretty much the same for most human purposes no matter where you are. Venus, for example, will
kill you within 0.2 seconds no matter where you are. Anywhere on Ganymede is basically ice below and vacuum above.
</p><p>
And even if a planet does have a variety of terrain, in many cases a group of adventurers won't travel far enough to notice anything but
what's in the local vicinity. It would be <i>possible</i> for Tatooine to have oceans and lakes and snow-capped peaks, and just for us never
to have seen them because we never saw anything outside the desert region. Land in the middle of the Sahara and do a survey by foot and see
what sort of impression you get of Earth.
</p><p>
So it's not entirely bad that all we ever see of Dagobah is a mucky swamp, or of Hoth a frozen field of ice.

It's always a temptation to have a group of more or less powerful NPCs take command when they become involved in PC shenanigans. This is not a good
idea. The PCs are the ones who are supposed to be the heroes of the story, after all.
</p><p>
So it is in fact a good idea to make your NPCs somewhat indecisive, under-motivated, or otherwise unlikely to take charge and act. This gives the PCs
the chance to show their mettle, take charge, make the decisions, and lead the group to glory in their endeavours.
</p><p>
The only real problem occurs when the PCs themselves are so wishy-washy that the NPCs need to become about as effective as a group of factionalised

Most roleplayers have little to no practical experience in military strategy and tactics. So when it comes to playing massed combat situations,
one way to decide what to do is to take guidance from historical military campaigns.
</p><p>
Emulating the victor is the easy way. If attempting to defend an impossible position with bowmen and knights on foot against Genoese crossbowmen
and tens of thousands of armoured, mounted knights, make sure you are heavily outnumbered. If attempting to repel a force of cavalry and men-at-arms
with longbowmen on St Crispin's Day, make sure you are vastly outnumbered. If defending a hospital stockade against Zulus, make sure you
are enormously outnumbered.
</p><p>
You can choose a different, and more creative, path by doing the <i>opposite</i> of what the losers did. If you field an overwhelming force against
a paltry number of defenders, whatever you do, <i>make sure the defenders are not English</i>!

Besides, you never know when that beggar in the street will turn out to be an evil enchantress on the prowl for victims to slap curses on,
a polymorphed dragon looking for someone to eat, or a vampire. If your GM is doing a half-decent job, some of them <i>will</i> be.

Keeping a log of game events is a good way to make sure you can remember important details in later sessions. It can also serve as a

Everything can be avoided in a game. At least, that's a principle that many people play by.
<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">Rocks may fall and everyone may die</a>, but unless you've royally
got up the GM's nose* you'll get some sort of saving throw. You may need to roll a natural 100 on percentile dice, but you always have a chance.
And once you have a chance, all it takes is some good roleplaying** to improve that chance.
</p><p>
And even if things <i>can't</i> be avoided for some reason***, they can still be avoided. You just need to make your roleplaying so compellingly
clever, cunning, and inspirational**** that the GM decides to give you a one in a million shot for the heck of it. And we all know that once you have
that agreement, your survival is <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">pretty much inevitable</a> through

Prophetic visions are difficult to handle in a roleplaying game. If you're writing fiction, you can make sure that the prophecy maps directly on
to later events. But a game is open-ended and events can take unexpected turns, which can quickly lead to positions in which your carefully
crafted prophecy is not only proved false, but also patently ridiculous. Yet prophecies remain a powerful staple of fantasy literature
and so it's natural to want to include some form of them in your games.
</p><p>
One solution is to frame prophecies vaguely. In the manner of Nostradamus, a suitably vague prophecy can be interpreted after later events as
having been about those events. The disadvantage here is that you can't draw those links <i>before</i> the events transpire - the prophecy only
becomes "clear" after the thing it supposedly discusses actually happens. Which is kind of useless and lame, as prophecies go.
</p><p>
Another approach is to make the prophecy of the "this will come to pass unless you do something about it" type. This gives the PCs the chance to
react to the prophecy and try to prevent it from happening - assuming it's the sort of thing that they don't want to happen. You can craft happenings
and NPC actions leading towards the prophesied event, and modify them based on PC actions, giving them a chance to influence the fate of their world.
</p><p>
This is the safest approach, since you just <i>know</i> that the players are going to mess up whatever you have planned.

One of the all-time classic pieces of GM assistance was the <b>Wandering Damage System</b>, printed in <i>Dragon</i> magazine #96,
an April Fool's issue. It's simply too useful to keep secret any longer, so here it is in all its glory:
</p><p>
<b>How To Use The Wandering Damage System</b>
</p><p>
First there was the wandering monster. They serve well when applied in hordes, but why not cut out the middleman and just deal
out damage to the characters directly? It makes for a smoother, faster-paced game, and if you want to kill off characters quickly, it
can only be beaten by divine intervention by Cthulhoid godlings.
</p><p>
Instructions: Whenever a player annoys you in any way, by wearing tasteless clothes or eating the last corn chip, ask him to roll a
d20. He may become worried that he's rolling a saving throw.
Ha, ha!!! Little does he know that he just rolled on the Wandering Damage System matrix!!! Repeat the roll as often as desired.

Often it's not clear what an NPC's motivations are - whether the NPC will help or hinder the PCs. So it pays to be circumspect until you
find out what their intentions are. The problem with this is that you don't want to give information to potential enemies, when at
the same time you might need to give that information to potential allies.
</p><p>
This is where Detect Evil and similar spells and magic items come in handy. In games without magic, you have to make do with some other approach.
Some methods make use of skills like Bluff, Diplomacy, Empathy, Psychology, and so on. You might even roleplay a conversation in detail.
</p><p>
But generally it's easier and more effective to just say whatever you feel like and mop up any damage later.

Creating new creatures for games is easy. Just take two normal animals and cross them.
</p><p>
Like, say, a shark and a squid. A shark-like creature with tentacles!
</p><p>
Or a sea lion... crossed with an actual lion!
</p><p>
Or an owl crossed with an elephant. Or an... armadillo crossed with an elephant!
</p><p>
Or an eagle with the head of a wolf! Or a <i>spider</i> with the head of a wolf!
</p><p>
And of course, one of the greatest original <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> monsters of all time, the

Amazingly, this is the first time the word "Munchkin" has appeared in either a strip or one of these commentaries.
</p><p>
Amazing because, for those who don't already know,
<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">"Munchkin" is a term used to describe certain types of gamer</a>, namely those
who make use of every avenue and loophole in the game rules to maximise the stats, abilities, and power level of their character, making
the character into an awesome overpowered killing machine capable of gathering more loot and experience and becoming ever more powerful,
even if it means occasionally pulling a fast one or ignoring certain other rules that might provide limitations. Oh, and roleplaying an
actual character concept is secondary to making the character ever buffer and the acquisition of more loot and more powerful weapons,
if it's considered at all.
</p><p>
Now do you see why it's amazing we've never mentioned this before?

Slavery can be a sensitive topic in the context of a roleplaying game. Enslaving entire races or species is heading even further
down the garden path. One way to treat it is to have your band of heroes fight against the slave traders. This does pose the risk of having
them perform morally upstanding actions though. Easier to just let them kill monsters and loot treasure, really.

Oddly enough nobody ever seems to have a problem with that.

Although pregnancy is a natural part of life, it <i>is</i> a bit tricky to work into a roleplaying game. Even without considering the
question of exactly <i>how</i> one of the characters gets pregnant. (Game mechanically, we mean!)
</p><p>
Realistically, being pregnant would put a bit of a crimp in your ability to scale the sides of a fortress, or swing on the rigging of a
pirate ship, or take on a horde of orcs in melee combat.
</p><p>
But roleplaying is a fantasy, and you don't need to be realistic if you don't want to. Who says your 8-month pregnant paladin can't
engage a red dragon and win? Or your overdue engineer can't crawl around in the cramped
engine ducts to squeeze an extra warp factor out of them? If you're running the game, they can!
</p><p>
You make dozens of acceptable breaks from reality to get into the world of a roleplaying game. One more won't hurt - if you don't want it to.
</p><p>
Oh, and this is another of the deleted scenes from this film. Again one of the more interesting scenes in terms of plot development

It is, usually, important to make sure the players are aware of what sort of campaign you're planning on running with them. This is not
universally the case, though.
</p><p>
One option is the <i>deliberately secret</i> campaign. Set up your players as though they're playing in a contemporary cops and robbers
setting. Or a Wild West game. Or a standard pseudo-medieval fantasy campaign.
</p><p>
And then things start to go a bit screwy. The PC cops uncovers some weird cult activity. The western gunslingers stumble on creepy ruins of
a native settlement. The fantasy adventurers find a strange item of power in a dragon's lair.
</p><p>
Reports start coming in from across the city of people dying mysteriously, their intestines ripped out, in sealed rooms. The native ruins
contain dusty pottery jars, that make weird moaning noises when touched. The magic item has a button which releases a blinding beam of light that
disintegrates anyone it touches.
</p><p>
The grisly murders are connected to the cult collecting enough life essence to summon forth eldritch Things That Man Was Not Meant To Know!
The jars contain ghosts that suck the life force from people and turn them into zombies! The trail of the magic item's last owner leads to
a gleaming cave of polished metal, which contains images of incredibly tall buildings, flying machines, and a war culminating in vast explosions
all over the world!
</p><p>
These revelations can shock your players. They can make for a memorable game... or one in which the players don't appreciate the twist.
Don't try it on them every time, and make sure you know your players well before you try this trick.

<i>Nobody</i> in a roleplaying game need be what they appear to be. The town mayor could be a doppelgänger. The chief of police might be
a serial killer. The king could, possibly, be a vampire.
</p><p>
On twists such as these are built compelling stories and adventures. The trusted NPC, perhaps the one who gave the PCs the quest in the first
place, turns out to be behind it all.
</p><p>
But to be effective, you can't have <i>everyone</i> be out to get them. You need to foster
an air of complacency and make them relax first, by having most of your NPCs be exactly what they appear to be. The mayor is genuinely a good guy.
The police chief is completely scrupulous in rendering assistance. The king is wise and good and everyone loves him. No, really.
</p><p>
And it turns out the stableboy who looks after the PCs' horses is the hidden threat! A trained assassin on a mission for a wizard bent on
using the PCs to release demonic evil into the world!
</p><p>
When this bombshell drops, the PCs can then run to the mayor, the police chief, and the king, to warn them and enlist their aid.
</p><p>
Only <i>then</i> is the correct time for them to discover the doppelgänger, the serial killer, and the vampire.

Roleplaying is, at its heart, a means of socialising with friends. People you have fun with, can share a joke with, and generally
trust to share good times. This air of camaraderie allows you to relax your inhibitions, open up, and express yourself freely,
on the shared knowledge that it's all in fun and nobody needs to be too serious about the whole business.
</p><p>
This mutual respect and support can, however, take a long time to cultivate. You need to ease into it slowly, and develop the
relationship with your fellow players gradually, earning their trust in the only way it can be earned. Time.
</p><p>
So if someone you've known for less than about ten years offers you their "special" dice... be very, very wary.

One can only presume that Obi-Wan really did make some sort of failed roll here. Wasn't he lecturing Anakin a while back to be more careful
with his laser sword, because, "This weapon is your life!"*
</p><p>
What sort of multiple failures would Obi-Wan really need to go through to drop his sword and not simply Force yank it back into his hand
immediately? First he'd need to not have holstered it safely, despite being on a rapidly moving and unstable animal that requires both hands to
hold on to the reins. Then he'd have to be so shocked by the landing of his lizard mount that he actually lets go of the weapon that
represents his entire disciplined life as a Jedi. Then he'd have to have his superhuman Jedi reflexes fail to grab the sword back before
it moves out of his grasp. Then he'd have to fail to think to use the Force to simply keep it from falling and return immediately to his hand.
</p><p>
Okay, make that <i>multiple</i> failed rolls. It's amazing he didn't also fall off the lizard.

The war room scene can be a cool one to play out. You have your array of generals and a big table or screen showing the planning or progress of
a battle. It doesn't need to be high-tech. You can just as well plan a battle between knights and archers while standing around in a tent
with your various lords and attendants.
</p><p>
One of the cool things about this is that the players around the gaming table can do exactly what the military planners and strategists
are doing, looking at a map and moving miniatures around on it. Rather than the map and miniatures in reality representing terrain and
people in the game, the map and miniatures in reality represent <i>a map and miniatures in the game</i>.

Madness is an aspect of life, and so something that might be simulated in a roleplaying game. The venerable <i>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>
had rules for insanity, on pages 83-84 of the original <i>Dungeon Masters Guide</i>. It listed 20 different types of insanity that could be
caused by various magical afflictions, curses, or psionic attacks. Among them was a type of "lunacy" which literally linked attacks of madness
to the phases of the moon, paying more than reality's mere lip service to the derivation of the word.
</p><p>
Probably the game that best utilises madness, though, is <i>Call of Cthulhu</i>. Any PC who <i>doesn't</i> eventually go mad in that game is
highly unusual, and very likely doing something wrong.
</p><p>
Much fun can be had by combining the sanity rules of <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> with other games. Realistically, the sorts of things that
happen to adventurers <i>are</i> pretty stressful. Attacked suddenly by orcs? Make a sanity roll. Strange iron statue comes to life when you
try to pry the jewel out of its eye socket? Make a sanity roll. Ambushed by bandits? Make a sanity roll.
Your horse throws a shoe? Make a sanity roll.

Okay, maybe not.

So, General Grievous is using a giant mono-wheel thing as a getaway vehicle. The thing is insanely impractical. Such things
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monowheel">exist in reality</a>, but have you ever seen one being used for regular commuting?
Because there are so many ways for it to fail spectacularly, that's why! We have a modern, industrial society in which we routinely
let people jump out of planes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_of_the_Bulls">get trampled by bulls</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_diving">dive inside caves</a>, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_wave_surfing">surf on 50-foot waves</a>. Yet we still don't let people on to our roads driving
monowheels.
</p><p>
Presumably the only reason for Grievous to use such a thing is because he's insanely reckless, and it has some impressive turn of speed
that can outrun anything.
</p><p>
Except a giant feathered lizard.
</p><p>
Seriously, in the movie Grievous has a huge head start on Obi-Wan. He's riding this gnarly hi-tech mono-wheel thing, while Obi-Wan
is on a lizard. And the lizard <i>catches up</i>. And <i>overtakes</i>.
</p><p>
Presumably it must have a +50 native terrain advantage or something.

Physically destroying the character sheets of a dead character can be a liberating and cathartic experience. We wholeheartedly recommend it.
</p><p>
Well, okay, with two caveats.
</p><p>
Ripping them up is slightly safer than accidentally setting fire to the house.
</p><p>
And, much more importantly, don't do it if your party includes a high enough level cleric to cast Raise Dead.

If you want to use prophetic visions and fortune telling in your games, make sure they're vague and easily misinterpretable.
The cool thing is that players will then latch on to the bits they can twist and interpret to make them sound as though they're
coming true, and ignore the bits that are blatantly wrong. And you'll come across as a genius.
</p><p>
Of course if you can make a very specific prophecy come true with a bunch of typical gamers, that's <i>true</i> genius. It's probably
never happened in the history of gaming.

Sharing your plans with fellow PCs...
</p><p>
is the surest way to have them completely messed up.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 554</h2>


<p>
If a player suggests something to an NPC for reasons that would clearly only benefit the player's own character, try having the NPC inexplicably
go along with it. The player will think they got lucky with a Fast Talk attempt or something, or the NPC is incredibly gullible. But if you do
this, make sure the NPC has well-grounded motivations of their own that can be made to appear to line up with the PC's plan - but that in
reality completely wreck whatever the PC had planned.
</p><p>
The cool thing about having secret NPC motivations is that the players will figure them out at different times. What will be a
complete mystery to some will be obvious to others.
</p><p>
And it often works out in the least expected way.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 555</h2>


<p>
When the plans of your players go horribly wrong, make sure to compound it by putting them on the spot and forcing them to explain themselves

<p>
One of the cool things about the original <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> and <i>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> games is that you can
<i>reverse</i> certain spells. This causes the spell to have an effect that is essentially the opposite of the normal version. Instead of
<i>Continual Light</i> you could cast <i>Continual Darkness</i>, merely by memorising the spell backwards. Better yet, clerics could reverse
some of their spells at casting time, simply by incanting them backwards. So instead of <i>Cure Light Wounds</i> you could do <i>Cause Light Wounds</i>.
It was noted, however, that good clerics using reversed spells are potentially putting their good alignment standing at risk.
</p><p>
This feeds back into any game in which magical, mystical, or even ultra-technological effects occur. Get something slightly wrong, or have one of the
conditions not completely satisfied, and you can justify pretty much <i>anything</i> happening.

<p>
It's an interesting roleplaying challenge to play a character with serious regrets about their past actions.
</p><p>
The good thing is that, depending on the game, you might be able to acquire some method of going back in time to fix it!
Try that for a character/adventure hook some time.

Any character worth their salt can use a personal army. But be very careful about handing them out as treasure.

Man, it sucks when everyone seems to be turning against you. It's times like this that people in a position of power need a strong friend.
Try to be that friend. (Unless all their friends end up assassinated, of course.)

It's good to have ambition in a game. It's what drives characters to seek adventure. The desire for more wealth, influence, and/or
arcane knowledge is the reason a blacksmith's apprentice takes up a sword and leaves town, an elven boatmaker leaves the forest to
see the wider world, or an innkeeper's daughter travels to a distant city to seek a wizardly mentor.
</p><p>
And the good thing is you can <i>always</i> go a step higher. Run the kingdom? There's always one next door. Run the world?
Try other planes of reality. Or other worlds. Power!

Emitting steam from your ears is a great trick for conveying your growing exasperation with your players refusing to have anything to

Reverse psychology is a good trick to try when players don't want to do what you want them to do. Such as remotely follow your game plot
or stay within the areas you've mapped. As opposed to, for example, building a spaceship out of bamboo and blasting off for remote galaxies
- when the game was intended to be restricted to a desert island in the Pacific. (I heard this actually happened once.)
</p><p>
Anyway, reverse psychology. We said it's a good trick to <i>try</i>. Don't blame us if it doesn't work. It might work on your kid sister, but

Your typical PCs go around slaughtering non-human races, stealing treasure, avoiding royal tax collectors, starting bar room brawls,
evading the city watch, lightening the purses of wealthy merchants, desecrating temples, laying siege to castles, lording

If you're going to use classic monsters in your games, the players will have certain expectations of how those monsters will behave,
what strengths they will have, and what weaknesses can be exploited to defeat them. For some players, this is good and comforting.
For others, this is uncreative and a path to boredom: "Ho hum, another kappa... We bow politely and deeply to it."
</p><p>
To mix things up and keep players on their toes, you need to adapt and modify. Make your evil faeries unaffected by iron, but vulnerable to copper.
Have mummies wearing Rings of Fire Resistance. Take green slime and make it red so it's difficult to identify.
This is all good fun and a great way to prevent player knowledge leaking into mysterious situations where their characters would be at a loss
for what to try.

Talking about game stuff in public where people can overhear what you're saying can be fraught with danger. Most people don't play
out fictional stories and events and so have no reason to discuss them as though they were the characters, which means that when most
people hear such things they don't immediately reach the correct conclusion that you're talking about fiction.
</p><p>
This can make you sound depraved or insane. The best defence is to point out that no, you're actually just a nerd. Although some

It shows the two orthogonal axes of good-evil and lawful-chaotic, and the nine regions created by the intersection of the three values
along each of these axes (neutral being the middle value on both axes). The alignment graph was a handy way of visualising how actions map
to the game mechanical concept of alignment.
</p><p>
Most players want to play good, law-abiding characters. Traditionally this can be done by keeping you actions within the blue zone
and avoiding the red zone, as shown below:

One of the eternal debates in roleplaying is whether or not to kill the children of evil races. Take orcs for example. They're evil.
All of them*. The kids will grow up to be evil. So you should kill them, right? Except they're just kids! You can't kill them!
But you have to! But you can't!
</p><p>
This is a serious issue, especially for high school kids struggling to figure out their own place in society and come to terms with how they
relate to other people. Who says roleplaying can't teach you important lessons about life?
</p><p>
We decided to kill them. Like 99% of young roleplayers faced with this scenario in a game. Now that it's out of our systems, we hardly
ever kill kids now that we're grown up.

The team of superhero PCs can thwart the diabolical Doctor Gloom's plans to take over the city of Gigalopolis, and even capture

For some fight scenes in games it's enough to throw dozens of faceless low-level mooks at the PCs - disposable henchmen they can despatch

Sometimes you just need to throw low-level flunkies at the PCs so they have endless hordes that they can mow down easily in a huge battle

Food is an important part of roleplaying. You can't sit around a table with four or five other people for four or five hours and not eat

meal - where everyone prepares and brings something. Organise it beforehand so you know you'll end up with an appetiser, a meat dish,

Many of you probably know <i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>. If not, and you are familiar with
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> or roleplaying games, you might enjoy it. If you are familiar with both, you <i>will</i> enjoy it.
</p><p>
Basically, Shamus Young, the creator, has treated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> as the fantasy campaign of a long-suffering Dungeon Master saddled with all too
typical players, and illustrated it in the form of a comic using screencaps from the movies. Brilliant idea, and very well done. And I constantly boggle that
(a) nobody did it before, and that (b) nobody has copied him yet.
</p><p>
Alas, <i>DM of the Rings</i> has recently come to an end, having told the story to the ending. Shamus has moved on to a
<a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/comic/default.aspx?c=14">new comic project</a>, which involves a collaboration with an artist. So no more movie screencap
comics from Shamus. This has led to a call from his legion of fans for someone, anyone, to fill the void:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Shamus:</b><br>
Which reminds me: This comic is popular enough that I'm surprised nobody else has done something similar. Harry Potter? Aliens? Spider-Man? X-Men? Star Trek?
Star Wars? The Matrix? There are tons of movies which are well known and take themselves very seriously, which are the two main ingredients for good satire.
I keep expecting another movie comic to appear someplace, but it hasn't happened yet.
</br></p><p>
<b>Adam Bloom:</b><br>
I think it's because the kind of person who thinks, "It would be funny to make a comic that spoofs Star Wars" is the kind of person who would read the amount
of work you put into each comic and say, "OMFG WAT???"
</br></p><p>
Whereas the kind of person who thinks, "I want to spend time and effort to make a high-quality webcomic" is not the kind of person who says, "It would be
funny to spoof Star Wars."

</p><p>
Because you can bet your bottom dollar that one of them will turn out to be
better than you. And <i>that</i> student will be the one to eventually fight you in an epic battle to the death.
</p><p>
At least it will be if your GM pays any attention whatsoever to how martial arts stories go.

It's good to incorporate background legends and mythology in your campaign world. Stories that aren't necessarily true, but that
characters within the world know as part of their cultural background. Most of the time this is just detailed world-building, but sometimes
it can provide a hook for the players and the NPCs to hang important plot stuff on.
</p><p>
This is the basic goal of campaign world building: providing hooks. You need to provide plenty of hooks, because your players will pick and
choose only certain ones to hang things on. The thing is, they'll have plot elements in their heads, just looking for these hooks. And if the
hooks aren't there, they won't get things attached to them and any potential story can unravel and end up loose on the floor. You can end up
with a world in which the PCs wander aimlessly from one encounter to the next, fighting monsters or villains, and then going in search
of the next challenge, but without any over-arching theme or story arc.
</p><p>
(This is a risk - we're not saying it <i>will</i> happen. Diligent GMing is a multi-faceted discipline, and you can weave a story out of
all sorts of threads if you spend the time and skill doing so. We're just suggesting one possible tool to make it easier.)
</p><p>
But with hooks in place, the players can pick them up and use them to weave their own story fragments. Build their own legends. Become a part of
the world-building. This achieves two things: lightens your load as the GM, and gets them intimately involved in the world.
</p><p>
Which of these two ends is more important may depend on your GMing style, but most GMs will agree that at least <i>one</i> of them is worthwhile.

PCs are the heroes of the game world. By definition, they're the good guys!

Well, at least the guys the players are cheering for, anyway.
</p><p>
Intra-party conflict is nothing new, though. After all, would your thief be truly worthy of that title if he didn't occasionally attempt
to pick the pockets of his compatriots? However it's rare that it escalates into actual fighting between PCs. Maybe if you catch that stinking
thief you should just whip out your sword and teach him a lesson...

It's important to minimise distractions when gaming. This is the reason games are often played indoors, at night time, sometimes even in
basements or rooms without windows. And why the gaming rooms at conventions are the small internal rooms of the function centre, without
any natural daylight.

Think about it. You never see a group of gamers with their rule books, character sheets, and dice out in the park on a fine sunny day,
or sitting on the beach, or sitting in the plaza in the middle of the city.*

Books are important resources for gaming. You can get a game idea out of almost any book you care to name. Fiction books are pretty
straightforward - you just take elements of the story, tweak them a bit to obfuscate the source, and integrate them into your game plot.
But non-fiction can be equally as inspiring. Some books are fairly straightforward, while others require some imaginative interpretation:

Any piece of equipment you have can be used in multiple ways. Don't be restricted to thinking of your 10-foot pole as merely a <i>pole</i>.
It can be used to hit monsters, it can be used to probe floors and ceilings for traps (do <i>not</i> forget the ceilings), it can be
used to hold up a tarpaulin to form a rain shelter, it can be used to brace an unsteady wall, it can be used to brace a door you don't
want opened, it can be used to poke under a door you can't open and swipe monsters on the other side off their feet, it can be used to
vault over pits or streams, it can be used to knock fruit (or monsters) out of trees, it can be used to tap on upper floor windows, it can
be used to push a barge along a river, it can be used to whack bees' nests and gather honey, it can be used to fend off lions, and tigers,
and bears, oh my, it can be used to hoist the heads of your enemies as a warning to attackers, it can be used as a really long pool cue.

And if you reverse the pole-arity, it can be used to fix warp engines!

It's important for NPCs to have their own motivations and goals. And not just enemies - allies are equally important. They shouldn't simply
be puppets of the PCs and go along with whatever they want. So try giving them a scene or two to establish their identity, their role in the
world, and their plans for the future.
</p><p>
And if things get in the way of those plans, that gives you seeds for recruiting the PCs into adventures aimed at setting things right again.

When <i>NPCs</i> start talking out of character, you know something isn't quite going right.

<p>
Sometimes in a game you need to do some things that <i>some</i> of the PCs know about, but that other PCs really <i>don't</i> know about, mainly
because the characters are not present in the scene in question. You can do this with all of the <i>players</i> knowing what's happening, but
this relies on their ability to keep player knowledge separate from character knowledge. And then sometimes you want things to be a genuine surprise
to the players, as well as their characters.
</p><p>
In such situations, the usual thing to do is ask some of the players to leave the room for a while, or take a subset of the players
aside into another room for a bit. If you thought passing notes to players was a good way to ramp up the paranoia, you ain't seen nothing yet.
</p><p>
In practice, this procedure should be limited to extreme circumstances, and the separate sessions kept short and sweet to avoid boredom in the
unattended group.
</p><p>
On the other hand, we've seen games in which two different groups of PCs are being run through an adventure simultaneously, with a single GM
running back and forth between rooms. The two groups don't know <i>anything</i> about what the other group is doing until they run into one another, at
which point the sessions can be combined. Just a warning: the GM's job scales roughly as the number of separate groups squared. And the number of
game-interrupting outbreaks of irrelevant conversation, Monty Python quotations, and people deciding to play Nintendo instead of the actual game
scales roughly exponentially.

Communication is one of the most influential aspects of a game scenario. Splitting up the party is a lot different in games with no
way to communicate between groups than it is in games where everyone has a radio or phone. If the party can communicate freely despite being
on opposite sides of the military base they're infiltrating, then they're almost effectively not split up at all.
</p><p>
The major conceptual difference between medieval/historical games and modern/future games is not the weaponry. It's the ability to split
up and still stay in communication.

Sunrise is an important time of day, heavily symbolic of new beginnings, renewal, and looking forward.
</p><p>
Most games don't take much notice of time of day or the weather, other than to tell the PCs that they need to make camp and sleep.
Use the cues and rhythms of the natural world to set a scene, a mood, and to symbolise the story behind what is happening. The wolf attack should
always take place during a thunderstorm. The rocket should launch by the light of the moon. Ships should sail on the morning tide with a fair
wind - unless of course it's on a Voyage of Fate. Duels should occur in the hot sun of high noon. Deals should be made with underworld
netrunners on the streets of Tokyo in a slippery grey rain that greases the steel and neon canyons with a sheen of modernity and slicked-down grime.

This is the first deleted scene from the film that is presented on the DVD. It is a scene in which Anakin and Obi-Wan briefly meet
General Grievous before finding Palpatine and Count Dooku. Grievous has somehow managed to capture the Jedi Master
<a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Shaak_Ti">Shaak Ti</a> and has her helpless on her knees. He then executes her in front of Obi-Wan
and Anakin, and they have to escape by cutting their way through the floor and jumping into a tunnel waist deep in some sort of liquid.
(It looks like fake CGI water, but it's apparently supposed to be fuel of some sort.)
</p><p>
We wanted to use this scene in the story. We even wrote a gag about Anakin and Obi-Wan falling into an area of the ship that the GM
hadn't mapped, because he never expected them to cut through the <i>floor</i>, thus the incomplete special effects appearance of the liquid
they end up sloshing around in. But it didn't fit into the narrative we planned with the revelation of General Grievous after the rescue of
Palpatine from Count Dookû, and the presence of Shaak Ti was a problem as well. So we decided not to use this scene in the story.
But we didn't want to let it pass unnoted, so we've used it here for this intermission strip.

Always know where the escape pods or life boats or similar such devices are located. This includes biplanes attached to zeppelins.
Whenever you board a commercial vessel, scout it out and plan your escape route in case of iceberg, fire, or sahuagin attack.
Memorise all paths to the means of escape, so you can follow them in pitch blackness. Even when carrying a cat cage and flamethrower
and being chased by an alien carnivore.
</p><p>
And if it's your own vessel, keep all the pods/boats in working order. Test them often. If your ship doesn't come with any sort of safety
escape means, install some. Have manual overrides so you can release them even if an enemy takes control of the ship's computer.
Equip them with rations, water, first aid kits, and wooden stakes. Just in case.

Young people these days. Mention "roleplaying games" to them, and the first thing they think of is a computer. This has progressed so far

This is a natural evolution of language, and similar things have been

The easiest way to teach new players how to roleplay is simply to throw them in the deep end. Don't bother going through a bunch of
rules or details about character creation, or what dice to roll in what situations. Just explain that everyone is playing the role of
a character and start playing. When they need to roll some dice, hand them the right dice and tell them what they need to roll.
That's all the rules you really need to know when you start.
</p><p>
You can run games with little kids this way. The game <i>Toon</i> is especially good for this. You don't need to tell them <i>anything</i> about how the
game works... Just say, "You're a rabbit, you're a cat, and you're a tweety bird," and let them go.

Many of you probably know <i><a href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=14">DM of the Rings</a></i>. If not, and you are familiar with
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> or roleplaying games, you might enjoy it. If you are familiar with both, you <i>will</i> enjoy it.
</p><p>
Basically, Shamus Young, the creator, has treated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> as the fantasy campaign of a long-suffering Dungeon Master saddled with all too
typical players, and illustrated it in the form of a comic using screencaps from the movies. Brilliant idea, and very well done. And I constantly boggle that
(a) nobody did it before, and that (b) nobody has copied him yet.
</p><p>
Alas, <i>DM of the Rings</i> has recently come to an end, having told the story to the ending. Shamus has moved on to a
<a href="http://www.feartheboot.com/comic/default.aspx?c=14">new comic project</a>, which involves a collaboration with an artist. So no more movie screencap
comics from Shamus. This has led to a call from his legion of fans for someone, anyone, to fill the void:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<b>Shamus:</b><br>
Which reminds me: This comic is popular enough that I'm surprised nobody else has done something similar. Harry Potter? Aliens? Spider-Man? X-Men? Star Trek?
Star Wars? The Matrix? There are tons of movies which are well known and take themselves very seriously, which are the two main ingredients for good satire.
I keep expecting another movie comic to appear someplace, but it hasn't happened yet.
</br></p><p>
<b>Adam Bloom:</b><br>
I think it's because the kind of person who thinks, "It would be funny to make a comic that spoofs Star Wars" is the kind of person who would read the amount
of work you put into each comic and say, "OMFG WAT???"
</br></p><p>
Whereas the kind of person who thinks, "I want to spend time and effort to make a high-quality webcomic" is not the kind of person who says, "It would be
funny to spoof Star Wars."

You are the rare, and wonderful, exception.

One of the major differences between face-to-face roleplaying and computer roleplaying is that when you are speaking to real people you
can say anything at all (that makes sense in your language) and be understood. Computer games still struggle to interpret the full complexity
of natural language. The stop-gap solution in early computer RPGs* was to offer the player a selection of pre-canned dialogue snippets that
they could choose from. The computer character's response could then be controlled to a small, finite** number of possibilities, from which further
canned possibilities were offered to the player, leading to other computer responses, and so on. The resulting branching structure of the
potential conversations is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_tree">dialogue tree</a>.
</p><p>
* Where "early" means any computer RPGs without some sort of arbitrary natural language parsing capability. Which is still almost all of them. (Text adventures don't count.)
</p><p>
** It's an oddity of natural language that the adjective "small" applied to the noun "number" should make the additional adjective "finite"
entirely redundant***, yet somehow leaving out the "finite" feels like it's understating the point too much.
</p><p>
*** Okay, not <i>entirely</i> redundant, for the mathematics nerds who know about different classes of infinities.

That's one thing about roleplaying games. You can be in them for the long haul. And you can put them on hiatus for various reasons - people
move away, go to university, get married, get a job, have kids, other unimportant stuff that gets in the way - and still come back to them
at any point in the future, and the gameplay will be just as good as you remember it. It won't feel outdated.
</p><p>
Oh, what? What do you mean Second Edition, Third Edition, and Fourth Edition? All the <i>real</i> roleplayers are still using First Edition!

When a new player joins an established game, it's important to bring them up to speed with the story so far. Normally this would be the job of the GM,
speaking out of character. But to really get the new recruit into the roleplaying spirit, try delivering the background in character, through
the other players.
</p><p>
Some players might even be eager to share their adventures. Just keep an eye on them so that you get some actual new adventure into the session.
</p>


<hr><h2 style="color: red;">Comic no. 705</h2>


<p>
Every character needs a motivation to get them interested in the adventure that the GM lays before them. For some it might be a thirst for
adventure, or a desire to travel and see the world beyond the town they grew up in. It may be a wish to do good deeds, to rescue the princesses
of the world from the dragons, or to overthrow the evil despot. Some have a calling to serve the gods of their world. Others seek knowledge
and arcane power. The occasional person may be seeking justice or revenge for a wrong inflicted on their family or village.
</p><p>
These are all good, flavourful motivations.
</p><p>
Then there's the character motivated by a desire to gain wealth. Which is also kind of okay. After all, many real people in our world are
motivated strongly by this, so there are bound to be such people in your game world.
</p><p>
Now, imagine if when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mallory">George Mallory</a> was asked, "Why do you want to climb Mount Everest?"

Reverse psychology is about the only psychology that works on gamers. Sometimes.

</p><p>
Of course this leads to doubly genre-savvy gamers not falling for anything less than reverse-reverse-<i>reverse</i> psychology. Where you say
you want them to do what you <i>don't</i> want them to do, so they think you're deliberately saying what you <i>do</i> want them to do so that
they'll think you <i>don't</i> want them to do that in order to trick them into going ahead and doing that, only then they're too smart for

Many games have "surprise" mechanics, which govern specific instances in which PCs or the opponents they are fighting are surprised. If the
opponents are surprised, the PCs gain some brief advantage in the opening moves of any ensuing combat. On the other hand, if the PCs
are surprised, the opponents get a chance to attack first with various bonuses.
</p><p>
Since it's difficult at best to accurately determine when the <i>players</i> are surprised, and this doesn't necessarily track when their
characters are surprised anyway, surprise is often determined somewhat arbitrarily using a dice roll for randomisation, sometimes
with modifiers based on traits such as the characters' perception statistics, circumstances such as darkness, and so on.

Another metal that has a ridiculously low melting point is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaK">NaK</a>, or sodium-potassium alloy.
Sodium melts at 97.7°C, so you could melt it with boiling water - remembering of course that sodium exposed to water reacts
spontaneously and violently explosively, so be careful. Potassium melts at 63.4°C, which can be done with hot tap water - remembering that
potassium is even more reactive than sodium and when it comes into contact with water the reaction is so violent that it also ignites the hydrogen
released from the water, causing an <i>additional</i> source of explosive combustion.
</p><p>
Mix these two extremely safe molten metals together and you produce the alloy known as NaK. The melting point of the alloy varies with
composition, and is a minimum with a mixture of 22% sodium to 78% potassium. This mixture has a melting point of -12°C. So it'll stay liquid,
even in the freezer compartment of your fridge. Though any moisture whatsoever that gets into contact with it will trigger an explosion.
</p><p>
What use is this wonderful stuff? It's used to cool nuclear reactors! Because it stays liquid at much higher temperatures than water
(and much higher temperatures than mercury too), and won't freeze solid in the pipes at room temperature.

Often this occurs without much fanfare. It could be a decision made in the heat of battle, amidst the whirls of blades and the roll of dice.
Or something that occurs in a conversation with the king, that changes the course of empires because the GM has decided that the king's reaction
will be based on what the PC does. You can set up situations like this.
</p><p>
But an interesting way to to approach them instead is to draw attention to them. Make it abundantly clear to the character (and the player)
that <i>this</i> one decision will have the potential to change <i>everything</i> about the campaign from now on. Lead them by the hand. Say,
"These are your choices." Explain what a decision either way will mean, and how it will flow on to affect things across the span of continents,

Grounding can be an effective game mechanic, in a sense. The cartoon roleplaying game <i>Toon</i> has such a mechanic. Since cartoon characters
never actually <i>die</i> as such, when you lose all your hit points you simply sit out of the game for three minutes (real time), then come back
in with your hit points restored! In effect, you're grounded from the game for three minutes, as a "punishment" for losing all your hit points.
</p><p>
Now imagine applying this to other roleplaying games for transgressions such as talking back to the (NPC) king, picking up a cursed magic
item in a dungeon, or taking the last slice of pizza when the GM wanted it.

Torture is not a pleasant topic, but it is something that could realistically come up in many RPG genres and scenarios.
</p><p>
If there's a justifiable reason for PCs to be tortured in a game, try relieving the horror and foreboding by making the torturers really
pleasant, cheerful people who enjoy their job.
</p><p>
Another neat tip is that it's difficult to physically torture your <i>players</i>(*), so it can be tough to elicit the desired information/confession
out of their characters through player/character sympathy. So go for psychological torture instead! Follow the example of the Venetian Republic,
which used to lock prisoners in a dark room with only the moderately painful inconvenience of being suspended from the ceiling by ropes tied
around the wrists. Inform the prisoners that this is stage one of the torture process. Hire people to sit comfortably in adjacent rooms
and <i>scream hideously</i>. Use the word "hideously" to describe their screams. Use it a lot.
</p><p>
This was the only form of torture used by the Venetian Republic. Records show that it elicited confessions almost without fail(**). That should be
good for a hideous penalty on the PC's Will roll (or whatever other game mechanic is used to resist torture).
</p><p>
Mwuah-hah-hah-hah-haaaaahhh!!!
</p><p>
(*) Unless ordering not enough pizza counts.
</p><p>
(**) At least, this is the story told to me (DMM) by the tour guide while visiting the dungeons of the Doge's palace in Venice. it may be slightly distorted from the truth, but it makes a good story for this annotation.
</p><p>
(Serious note) Torture can be a touchy subject for some people. Do not simulate it, describe it, or even mention it in RPGs unless you are <i>absolutely sure</i> all of your players will be okay with it.

This is a bit of a meta-annotation. Judging from reader comments in various places, this is definitely the single most anticipated scene
for our comic, in the entire six movies. There have been dozens of theories about how we would approach this scene - we've read many of them.
The most common were variants on the GM initially declaring that Greedo (a green-skinned alien) shot first, followed by an argument over initiative
bonuses that leads to him declaring that, okay, Han (the human) actually shot first.
</p><p>
While this is amusing, we didn't want to do something that many of you were expecting. We actually had about a dozen different ideas for how
to run this scene - and we may show some of them to you later on.
</p><p>
We've never been about doing "the obvious joke". You can all imagine the obvious gags well enough for yourselves. We wanted to give you something
completely unexpected. Thus... Jim's character.
</p><p>
We hope this take gives you something you never expected to get out of this scene. And we hope to keep subverting your expectations for another
two and a half movies. :-)
</p><p>
EDIT: We should clarify this slightly. This is such an iconic scene that it became a target for our writing very early on. Way back in 2007,
shortly after we began work on <i>Episode I</i>, we wrote about a dozen different versions of this scene. As we worked on our long term
plotting, we settled on one that we figured would be less obvious and more surprising than most. We did not pick it in response to
reader speculation - it was set in stone much earlier than any of that. We don't change our plot in response to reader comments.
</p><p>
We know not everyone will like the path we chose. But that would have been true no matter what we did. We decided the best thing
to do was to be true to our own vision of our story.

Try giving your villains, if not strictly defined alignments, at least distinct personalities and approaches to what they want.

Bargaining can be difficult if you live in a culture where it's not the norm. Especially when the only exposure you get to it is on
trips to different countries, and those different places have their own unwritten rules and expectations built into the process.
</p><p>
For example, in various places in Asia, if you pay more than about half the initial asking price for anything, you're essentially being
fleeced. When you ask how much something is, if they say 100, you're expected to offer them 20 as a starting point, and the to and fro
process of bargaining is underway.
</p><p>
If you've learnt that and then you travel to, say, Peru, you might come across someone asking 100 for something. If you offer 20 in response,
the reaction will either be that you have amused them beyond belief, or that you have insulted them beyond belief. You better hope they're in
a good mood. Because there, if you bargain someone down to 10% off, you've done a good job.*
</p><p>
Roleplaying games tend to use bargaining a bit, but it's kind of expected that PCs buy goods at a set price as given in the rulebook equipment
lists, and if PCs try to sell stuff, they pretty much know they can expect to get about half that price. Which makes the bargaining a bit
perfunctory. Instead, try mixing it up a bit. Have the unwritten bargaining protocols change drastically from country to country, or even
from town to town. Throw in some really unusual stuff, like the expectation that the buyer must also buy the seller a drink to seal the deal.
Or that the first offered buying price must be deliberately <i>over</i> what the seller expects to get, so that the seller can make a point
of how miserable an item it is, and in his humble opinion it's not worth nearly that much, perhaps the buyer would care to offer less?
</p><p>
Of course, if a foreigner is ignorant of these traditions, things can (and should) go awry. Doubly of course, PCs should be ignorant of
these traditions until they need to buy or sell something...

Han's line about the Kessel Run in the movie has a long and convoluted back-story. The various drafts of the film script include notes about
Han's boast that the <i>Millennium Falcon</i> is "the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs". The problem of course
is that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec">parsec</a> is a unit of distance, not time. (At least in English it is - but then the
characters are speaking English on the screen, so one may reasonably assume that words have the same meanings they do in regular English.)
</p><p>
The revised fourth draft of the film script makes it very clear what Han's line means. Immediately after the line, it says:
</p><blockquote>
<i>Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation.</i>
</blockquote><p>
In other words, Han is trying to boast, and using a word he doesn't know the meaning of, which makes it obvious to Obi-Wan that he's lying
through his teeth. Even in the shooting script, Han's line is followed by a note stating that he is "obviously lying".
</p><p>
Which is all well and good, but unfortunately even the acting talent of Sir Alec Guinness did not make it quite clear enough that Han's
line was intended to be interpreted as a completely bogus fabrication. The result is that masses of <i>Star Wars</i> fans have tried to come up with a
reason why the Kessel Run really could be flown in "less than twelve parsecs".
</p><p>
If you take Han's line at face value (rather than a transparent lie), the most favoured explanation is that the
<a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kessel_Run">Kessel Run</a> is a smuggling route
that skirts a cluster of black holes (known as <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Maw">The Maw</a>). The standard, relatively safe, route
around The Maw is somewhat circuitous and measures 18 parsecs long. Daring pilots can cut closer to The Maw, trimming distance off the route,
at some risk to life and limb. Han Solo, being the daring pilot he is, managed to cut so close that he got the distance down to less than
twelve parsecs, and thereby making the run in record time.
</p><p>
This explanation eventually became so favoured that it has been officially adopted into the <i>Star Wars</i> Expanded Universe canon.
</p><p>
Which raises a whole bunch of other questions about the consistency of what was actually intended versus what has later become canon. In short,
a whole Galaxy of woe could have been prevented if only it was made clearer in the first place that Han was simply clueless.

Characters in a roleplaying game are people too. So it's certainly possible for them to have hobbies that they engage in during periods
of down time between adventuring activity. Some game systems have skills specifically for characters to take if they want to be good
at things like sports and games. Putting a few points into such a skill can round out an otherwise adventure-focused character and
make them more believable, and even fun to play.
</p><p>
Imagine a character who's a sports nut. Always keen to hear the latest scores. Idolises the star professional players. Plays a bit
himself in a friendly local competition.
</p><p>
Imagine such a character in a dark fantasy world, where the sport is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Bowl">Blood Bowl</a>.

Kids learn new things really fast. Everyone knows that. Their minds are geared towards learning stuff and gaining rapid experience from all the new
things they see around them.
</p><p>
So if you <i>play</i> a kid in a roleplaying game, they should get an experience bonus and advance in skill levels faster than anyone else.
Try that one on your GM next time!

That means you can do pretty much whatever you like in the middle of an adventure. If it all works out, cool! If it doesn't, then the GM
probably wasn't going to let you succeed anyway!*

Mystical sight in fiction often involves <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindfoldedVision">switching off your normal senses</a>

It is vitally important to keep your out-of-game knowledge separate from your in-character knowledge, and to act naturally when discussing

Now here's a trick you can pull on an unsuspecting group of players. Have one of the players be secretly controlling one of their adversaries,
unknown to the <i>other</i> players. The main difficulty is arranging it so that the GM can convincingly portray the antagonist as an
NPC without arousing suspicion. Rather than go the detailed and clumsy route of passing notes for every single thing the antagonist says,
it's better to have the GM and conspiring player meet for a bit to discuss general character motivations and directions, and then
trust the GM to ad-lib within the parameters of that space.
</p><p>
This of course assumes the player you're conspiring with isn't a control freak.
</p><p>
Which might be okay, since usually in any game situation the biggest control freak will gravitate towards the job of being the GM anyway.

Mercenaries should of course be... mercenary. Any opportunity to turn someone else's misfortune into a quick buck should be grabbed
and made the most of. There's no need to be impolite about it though. That's the one mistake PCs often make. Why raid a cave system
full of goblins, slaughtering all before you at considerable risk to life and limb, when you can simply rock up to the front door, make pleasant
conversation about how nice a cave system it is, and how it'd be a right shame if anything were to happen to it, while meaningfully
picking your teeth with a two-handed sword?

Landing a spaceship is presumably a terrifying task requiring vast amounts of training. Landing a plane is a thing you need a lot
of training for, and can be risky and nerve-wracking. Landing a <i>spacecraft</i> is a thing that only a handful of humans have ever done,
and every single one of them was about as intensely trained for the job as anyone can be.
</p><p>
Yet this is usually abstracted away with a single skill roll in a game. Or even assumed to occur safely without any need for a roll at all,
in the absence of complicating conditions. Which kind of makes sense from a logical point of view. After all, trained pilots do succeed in
landing safely more than 99.99995% of the time*, whereas if you insist on even not rolling a critical failure with a +10 skill bonus in, say,
<i>GURPS</i>, that corresponds to 1 accident in every 216 landing attempts. Clearly you can't take that as a realistic simulation of
the piloting job.
</p><p>
But! Logic be damned! It's much more fun to have PCs try landing craft in complicated situations where all sorts of etxraneous circumstances
come into play. Storms! Enemy fire! Aliens breaking into the cockpit while you have nothing to hold them back with but the plastic cutlery
given to economy class passengers to eat their in-flight meals! Make every flight an event! Make every landing an adventure in itself!
</p><p>
Remember, any landing the PCs can walk away from means you didn't throw in enough complications.
</p><p>
* <a href="http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/pages/2012-03-06-01.aspx">This page</a> quotes accident rates of approximately 1 per 2 million flights,
and presumably only a fraction of those are landing accidents.

The PA system can be a useful means of addressing characters in the right game settings. Consider its role in the classic TV comedy
<i>M*A*S*H</i> - the PA announcements were virtually a character unto themselves.
</p><p>
The game <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia_%28role-playing_game%29">Paranoia</a></i> has The Computer, of course, which
plays a similar sort of "voice from above" role that interacts with the PCs. But you could also incorporate it into other genres.
Imagine a PA system making announcements at a passenger spaceflight terminal, or on board a long-haul cruise vessel when things start to
go mysteriously bizarre. Or on a space station.

Or in the streets of London on an otherwise normal contemporary day...

NPCs should have a sense of self-preservation. Don't just line them up willingly, ready to be killed by the PCs.
</p><p>
Some games have morale rules to handle this. If an NPC is in danger, the GM makes a roll against some sort of bravery or loyalty or morale stat,
and the result determines if the NPC stands his ground or turns tail and flees.
</p><p>
As a PC, you naturally want to encourage your enemies to hang around and fight, rather than flee. So you should do stuff to improve
their morale, like complimenting them on their armour or offering them chocolates.

NPCs have jobs too, and some of them probably really enjoy what they do.
</p><p>
Imagine all those people in the supervillain's sub-volcano lair, doing maintenance on the rocket gantry, operating the monorail, providing

for their job.
</p><p>
If the PCs meet some of these sorts of low level "villains", it may not be clear if they should fight their way through them, or inform them
of what's going on and save them.

This is interesting from a roleplaying perspective. The scene shows an interaction with the PCs, but from the NPCs' point of view.
Necessarily we have to run with that, since it's what we're given in the movie.
</p><p>
But you could potentially try something like this in a game. Have the PCs describe their actions, then resolve the situation and
describe it back to the players <i>from the point of view of the NPCs</i>. I don't know how this would work in practice,
but it's be an intriguing experiment, and might be fun.

Have you ever played tennis and ended up with a strained elbow? Or tried lifting something heavy and felt a nasty twinge somewhere? Or how
about that time you sneezed really hard and pulled a muscle?

Now imagine what would happen if you were running around, hitting people, dodging weapons fire, and generally doing the sorts of things
that PCs do all the time.
</p><p>
For increased realism, every time a PC does something strenuous you should roll on some sort of "pulling a muscle" table. Really, these guys should
be falling apart and limping around all over the place.

(N.B. Implementing this idea may or may not increase your enjoyment of an actual game. Depending how sadistic a GM you are.)

Of course the villains are going to have alarm systems of some kind in their lairs. Whether it be magical runes, a system of ropes and
